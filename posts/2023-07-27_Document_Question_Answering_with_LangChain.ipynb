Firstly, vacancy rates have fallen to very low levels across the country since the pandemic, meaning there is a shortage of available rentals. This is particularly evident in cities like Sydney and Melbourne. \\n\\nAdditionally, the departure of investors from the rental market has impacted rental supply. Many investors chose to sell their rental properties during 2020 and 2021, and there are few new investors entering the market to replace them. \\n\\nOn the other hand, demand for rentals has been strong in many parts of the country, especially in inner-city areas. The return of international students, migrants, and office workers to CBDs has led to a surge in demand for rental properties. \\n\\nOverall, these factors have created a tight rental market with low vacancy rates and increasing rental prices, making it difficult for individuals to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023.',\n",

    "As part of this blog post, using a case study of a **not-for-profit** chatbot that I have recently built for volunteers/attendees at a Hindu temple, I am going to showcase how to properly setup evaluation and monitoring for user facing chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using `gpt-4o-mini` as the language model to talk to the users, as this is a self-funded project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me introduce the case study: \n",
    "\n",
    "*The temple I volunteer at hosts multiple events/satsangs every week. The invites are shared as Whatsapp Images amongst the volunteers. Generally, the invites contain some text in Hindi language at the top, title & event information such as address, date, start time, and any additional information related to the event. The more invites one get's, the harder it is to manage and plan ahead. Since, the invites are images only, it is harder to search for the host names or other information when one forgets the dates. This leads to a frantic search of all invite images in various Whatsapp chats and groups until one finds the right one. Every volunteer has there own way of managing the invites and preparing their schedule. I personally used to manually enter all details in my phone's calendar and setup appropriate reminders. Another volunteer I know uses a chalk-board to manage all invites, RSVP information and dates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the context, we want to help all volunteers in such a way that use of this app is completely optional without disrupting the usual way of doing everything. So, what if one could just forward the invite image to a WhatsApp Number, and in return get a downloadable calendar invite that has all the required information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The application should be extremely easy to use, because most of the users are elderly Hindus.\n",
    "- The application is free text, in terms of input & output.\n",
    "- The response from the application is a `.ics` downloadable calendar file, containing all the required information such as title, event date, start time, RSVP details, and any additional information about the event.\n",
    "- The model does not respond to any other requests from the user, and talks in a language that elderly Hindus appreciate. Otherwise, we risk rejection of this application amongst the elderly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the tech stack: \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) to interact with all volunteers and temple attendees using WhatsApp. Twilio internally uses Webhooks and makes a HTTP request to our application, passing in all the required data. We will build a flask app and use `/webhooks` endpoint to interact with Twilio. To learn more about how Twilio works, refer [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks). For the purposes of building an end-user application, we do not necessarily need to delve into the details of Twilio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall architecture of our application has been shared above in @fig-1."

    "The workflow is pretty straightforward, a User has an option to share text or image with a Whatsapp number (powered by Twilio). Twilio internally sends all data to a webhook, this webhook is made public by Replit which hosts all the code. Once we get the input data from Twilio, we process the image and text, and make a request to `gpt-4o-mini` accordingly to get a response. `gpt-4o-mini` handles all the image processing, and returns RSVP information. We use the RSVP information response from `gpt-4o-mini`, and use `icalendar` to write a `.ics` file that is shared back with the User."

While there are other options out there as well, we will use LangSmith for ease-of-use. Lastly, for (3), that is, for user satisfaction tracking, we need a way to record feedback from users via Whatsapp itself. If a user gives a thumbs up emoji to the response, that is a +1, and if a user gives a negative emoji to the response, that refers to a thumbs down. \n",

    "text": "2 Chatbot: Implementation in langchain\nLet’s say you have a number of documents, in my case, I have a bunch of markdown documents. And we want to build a question answering chatbot that can take in a question, and find the answer based on the documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chatbot architecture\n\n\n\nIn essence, the chatbot looks something like above. We pass the documents through an “embedding model”. It is easy enough to use OpenAI’s embedding API to convert documents, or chunks of documents to embeddings. These embeddings can be stored in a vector database such as Chroma, Faiss or Lance.\nThe user interacts through a “chat interface” and enters a question/query. This query can also be converted to an embedding using the embedding model. Next, we can find the nearest chunks (similar to the query) using similarity search, then pass these nearest chunks (referred to as “context”) to a Large Language Model such as ChatGPT.\nFinally, we retrieve an answer and this answer get’s passed back to the user in the chat interfact. We store this interaction in chat history and continue.\nThat is all in theory, in code, using langchain, above would look like:\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.chroma import Chroma\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, UnstructuredMarkdownLoader\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n\n# directory to store vector database\npersist_directory = \".db/\"\nopenai_api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']\n# loader that loads `markdown` documents\nloader = DirectoryLoader(\"./output/\", glob=\"**/*.md\", loader_cls=UnstructuredMarkdownLoader)\n# text splitter converts documents to chunks\ndocs = loader.load()\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=128)\nchunks = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n# embedding model to convert chunks to embeddings\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=openai_api_key)\n\n# load vector database, uncomment below two lines if you'd like to create it\n\n#################### run only once at beginning ####################\n# db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory=persist_directory)\n# db.persist()\n####################################################################\ndb = Chroma(persist_directory=persist_directory, embedding_function=embeddings)\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(\n    memory_key=\"chat_history\", output_key='answer', return_messages=False)\n\n# create QA chain using `langchain`, database is used as vector store retriever to find \"context\" (using similarity search)\nqa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\n    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo'),\n    chain_type=\"stuff\",\n    retriever=db.as_retriever(),\n    get_chat_history=lambda o:o,\n    memory=memory,\n    return_generated_question=True,\n    verbose=False,\n)\n\n\n# let's ask a question\nqa({\"question\": \"Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?\", \"chat_history\": []})\n\n{'question': 'Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?',\n 'chat_history': '',\n 'answer': 'In June 2023, it is hard to find a rental property in Australia due to several factors. Firstly, vacancy rates have fallen to very low levels across the country since the pandemic, meaning there is a shortage of available rentals. This is particularly evident in cities like Sydney and Melbourne. \\n\\nAdditionally, the departure of investors from the rental market has impacted rental supply. Many investors chose to sell their rental properties during 2020 and 2021, and there are few new investors entering the market to replace them. \\n\\nOn the other hand, demand for rentals has been strong in many parts of the country, especially in inner-city areas. The return of international students, migrants, and office workers to CBDs has led to a surge in demand for rental properties. \\n\\nOverall, these factors have created a tight rental market with low vacancy rates and increasing rental prices, making it difficult for individuals to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023.',\n 'generated_question': 'Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?'}\n\n\nLooking at the answer above, it really answers the question - “Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?” very well. Above might only be a few lines of code, but there is actually quite a lot going on underneath. Refer to Figure 1 for everything that’s going on underneath.\nBut, as a recap, and matching our steps with code shared above:\n\nLoad markdown files in a list loader = DirectoryLoader(\"./output/\", glob=\"**/*.md\", loader_cls=UnstructuredMarkdownLoader)\nCreate a splitter that can split documents to chunks text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=128)\nConvert each chunk and store as Embeddings in a Chroma DB Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory=persist_directory)\nUse the database as retriever to get relevant text (context), and based on ‘question’, use OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) model to answer question based on context.\n\nConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\n    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo'),\n    chain_type=\"stuff\",\n    retriever=db.as_retriever(),\n    memory=memory,\n    verbose=False,\n)\n\nAlso store conversation as chat history in memory memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", return_messages=False)\n\n\n2.1 Text splitter\nFor our simple usecase, we are using a text splitter of type CharacterTextSplitter.\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=128)\nWe are using a chunk_size of 1024, which means that the document will be divided into chunks of size 1024, and there will be 128 character overlap between each of the chunks.\nThe CharacterTextSplitter used above splits texts based using regex and a separator. The separator in this case is '\\n\\n'. Thus, anytime there are two line breaks, our text splitter will split documents. Internally, in LangChain to split a text, _split_text_with_regex is being called.\n# simplified version without `keep_separator`\ndef _split_text_with_regex(\n    text: str, separator: str, keep_separator: bool\n) -&gt; List[str]:\n    # Now that we have the separator, split the text\n    if separator:\n                splits = re.split(separator, text)\n    else:\n        splits = list(text)\n    return [s for s in splits if s != \"\"]\nThere are many other text splitters that we could have also used. For a complete list - refer here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne good one to further try would be - MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter. This particular splitter splits based on markdown headings, and it might be more useful for our usecase.\n\nRemember, the idea of chunking is to keep text with common context together.\n\n\n\nNow, that we have created our first bit, a text splitter that can split documents to chunks, let’s move on to the embedding model.\n\n\n2.2 Embedding model\nAlso, for our embedding model - we are using OpenAIEmbeddings. The main idea for the embedding model is to convert the chunks from before to embeddings.\nRemember, an embedding is only a vector representation of the text.\nSo, how do we convert our chunks (few sentences long) to a bunch of numbers? We can use openai’s embeddings API. Without langchain, this looks something like:\n\nimport openai\nchunk = \"This is a sample chunk consisting of few sentences.\"\ndef get_embedding(text, model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\"):\n   text = text.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n   return openai.Embedding.create(input = [text], model=model)['data'][0]['embedding']\n\nemb = get_embedding(chunk, model='text-embedding-ada-002')\nlen(emb)\n\n1536\n\n\nIn langchain, to achieve the same we instantiate from OpenAIEmbeddings.\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\ntext = \"This is a test document.\"\nquery_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)\nlen(query_result)\n\n1536\n\n\nNow, to embed all chunks at once, OpenAIEmbeddings has a method called embed_documents.\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nimport numpy as np\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\ndocs = [\"This is test document 1.\", \"This is test document 2.\"]\nembs = embeddings.embed_documents(docs)\nnp.array(embs).shape\n\n(2, 1536)\n\n\nGreat, now that we have a way to embed all documents, let’s look at vector database next.\n\n\n2.3 Vector database\nConsider the vector database to a repository of knowledge. All our chunks get converted to embeddings and get stored in a vector-db. In our case, we are using chroma-db.\nLooking at the documentation, we start by creating a client, and then a collection. Once we have a collection ready, it is very simple to query the collection to get back the results.\nresults = collection.query(\n    query_texts=[\"This is a query document\"],\n    n_results=2\n)\nWhat goes under the hood inside langchain, is that we first instantiate a chroma-db collection. Next, we use collection’s upsert method passing in embeddings and texts. And this way, we have created our vector database that can be used to find nearest chunks from our documents based on “query” using similarity-search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n❓ Some questions here to ask would be\n\nWould results look different or better if we used Cohere Embeddings? What would be the price difference?\nWhat would the quality of results be like if we used open source models like Llama-v2 released a few days ago?\nWhat if we used sentence-transformers?\nDo we really need a vector database? Can we store the embeddings as a np.array and use cosine-similarity to find nearest embeddings?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Q&A ChatBot\nSo far we have looked at text-splitter, embedding model and vector database. These are the building blocks of the chatbot. But, how do we bring the building blocks together?\nIn langchain, all the pieces come together in ConversationalRetrievalChain which is the main topic of this blog post too. We instantiate an instance of the class using @classmethod called from_llm.\nqa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\n    llm=OpenAIChat(temperature=0, max_tokens=-1),\n    chain_type=\"stuff\",\n    retriever=db.as_retriever(),\n    memory=memory,\n    get_chat_history=lambda x: x,\n    verbose=True,\n)\nresponse = qa({\n    \"question\": \"Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?\", \n    \"chat_history\": []\n})\nThere are two main things that go on inside a conversational retrieval chain.\nA conversational retrieval chain can take in a query, and based on the input query (question) and chat-history, it updates it to a new question.\nThis new question is then passed to a second document chain, to find the nearest chunks (based on question) - referred to as “context”, and this context alongside the new question get’s passed to a large language model (such as gpt-3.5-turbo or ChatGPT), to retrieve the answer.\nSo, internally - ConversationalRetrievalChain consists of two chains:\n\nA question generator chain, which updates input query/question based on chat history (LLMChain)\nAnd a document chain to join retrieved documents/chunks together (StuffDocumentsChain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn LLMChains\n\n\n\nGood news! We have already covered LLMChains in our previous blog post before here. In essence, given a prompt, the LLMChain can be used to generate an answer based on the prompt.\nGoing forward, I am going to assume that the reader has read the previous blog post and has a solid understanding of LLMChains & Chains in general.\n\n\nFrom our previous blog post, we know that anytime we call any chain in langchain, the __call__ method from Chain class gets invoked which in turn makes a call to _call method of derived class.\nThe ConversationalRetrievalChain is a subclass of BaseConversationalRetrievalChain which in turn is a subclass of Chain.\nThe _call method is implemented inside BaseConversationalRetrievalChain and it looks like below:\n    def _call(\n        self,\n        inputs: Dict[str, Any],\n        run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForChainRun] = None,\n    ) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:\n        _run_manager = run_manager or CallbackManagerForChainRun.get_noop_manager()\n        question = inputs[\"question\"]\n        get_chat_history = self.get_chat_history or _get_chat_history\n        chat_history_str = get_chat_history(inputs[\"chat_history\"])\n\n        if chat_history_str:\n            callbacks = _run_manager.get_child()\n            new_question = self.question_generator.run(\n                question=question, chat_history=chat_history_str, callbacks=callbacks\n            )\n        else:\n            new_question = question\n        accepts_run_manager = (\n            \"run_manager\" in inspect.signature(self._get_docs).parameters\n        )\n        if accepts_run_manager:\n            docs = self._get_docs(new_question, inputs, run_manager=_run_manager)\n        else:\n            docs = self._get_docs(new_question, inputs)  # type: ignore[call-arg]\n        new_inputs = inputs.copy()\n        if self.rephrase_question:\n            new_inputs[\"question\"] = new_question\n        new_inputs[\"chat_history\"] = chat_history_str\n        answer = self.combine_docs_chain.run(\n            input_documents=docs, callbacks=_run_manager.get_child(), **new_inputs\n        )\n        output: Dict[str, Any] = {self.output_key: answer}\n        if self.return_source_documents:\n            output[\"source_documents\"] = docs\n        if self.return_generated_question:\n            output[\"generated_question\"] = new_question\n        return output\nIn simple terms, first, the question_generator chain is called that updates the input question/query based on chat history.\nNext, we retrieve the documents based on our new_question using similarity search.\nThese retrieved docs, then get passed to combine_docs_chain which combines the retrieved chunks and passes them over to a large language model (in this case gpt-3.5-turbo) to get back the answer.\nLet’s understand both chains one by one in the next two sections. That way, we will be able to have a solid understanding of our conversational retrieval chain.\n\n2.4.1 Question generator chain\nLet’s start out with the question generator. Remeber, the question generator takes in the user question and a chat history, and based on chat history, it updates the question to a new question.\nWhy does it do that? The question generator rephrases the original question to be a standalone question. So if it is a follow up question like “Why did that happen?” from the user, remember, we do not know what “that” is in this particular question.\nSo, what the question generator will do, is that it will look at the chat history, and fill information for the word “that” to update the question to be a standalone question. So the new question could be “Why did the rental prices increase in Australia?” based on chat history.\nWe will also be looking at a working example of this in our code in this section.\nFrom a code perspective, in langchain, the question_generator is an instance of LLMChain.\nIn this case the prompt for the question generator (LLMChain) is CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT which looks like:\n_template = \"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question, in its original language.\n\nChat History:\n{chat_history}\n\nFollow Up Input: {question}\nStandalone question:\"\"\"\n\nCONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(_template)\nSo taking in a chat_history and the original question (from the user), internally a new question get’s generated! This new question is a standalone question as discussed at the start of this section.\nLet’s see it in action. Let’s see how the original question get’s updated to a new question based on chat_history. Remember, the first time we interact with the question answer bot, chat history is NULL, so no new question is generated. But, it works from the second time forward.\nWe can get langchain to return the newly generated question by passing in return_generated_question=True to the ConversationRetrievalChain.\n\nqa.memory.chat_memory.messages\n\n[HumanMessage(content='Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n AIMessage(content='In June 2023, it is hard to find a rental property in Australia due to several factors.

Let’s now ask a follow up question about the home price index and say “How has the pandemic affected this?” and we can see the question generator in action.\n\nqa(\"How has the pandemic affected this?\")\n\n{'question': 'How has the pandemic affected this?',\n 'chat_history': 'Human: Why is it so hard to find a rental property in Australia in June 2023?\\nAI: In June 2023, it is hard to find a rental property in Australia due to several factors.

This was done based on the chat history.\nAnd that’s all that there is to know about the question generator! We can now move on the document chain which is StuffDocumentsChain.\n\n\n2.4.2 Document chain\nThe stuff documents chain is available as combine_docs_chain attribute from the conversational retrieval chain.\nThe StuffDocumentsChain itself has a LLMChain of it’s own with the prompt\nsystem_template = \"\"\"Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n----------------\n{context}\"\"\"\nmessages = [\n    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template),\n    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"{question}\"),\n]\nCHAT_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(messages)\n\n\nPROMPT_SELECTOR = ConditionalPromptSelector(\n    default_prompt=PROMPT, conditionals=[(is_chat_model, CHAT_PROMPT)]\n)\nSo, we to our prompt, we pass in the context and a follow up question. It specifically says “just say that you don’t know, don’t try to make up an answer.” This is good to limit hallucination.\nWhen we call the StuffDocumentsChain, it does two things - first it calls combine_docs. This method first combines the given input chunks by using separator \\n\\n to generate context.\n    def _get_inputs(self, docs: List[Document], **kwargs: Any) -&gt; dict:\n        # Format each document according to the prompt\n        doc_strings = [format_document(doc, self.document_prompt) for doc in docs]\n        # Join the documents together to put them in the prompt.\n        inputs = {\n            k: v\n            for k, v in kwargs.items()\n            if k in self.llm_chain.prompt.input_variables\n        }\n        inputs[self.document_variable_name] = self.document_separator.join(doc_strings)\n        return inputs\n\n\n    def combine_docs(\n        self, docs: List[Document], callbacks: Callbacks = None, **kwargs: Any\n    ) -&gt; Tuple[str, dict]:\n        inputs = self._get_inputs(docs, **kwargs)\n        # Call predict on the LLM.\n        return self.llm_chain.predict(callbacks=callbacks, **inputs), {}\nGiven our question, remember, we first find the closest chunks to the question. These chunks are then joined together using \\n\\n separator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n❓ I wonder how things would look like if we numbered the various chunks and passed in the context as bullet points?\n\n\nNext, we just call LLMChain’s predict method, this generates an answer using a prompt and returns the answer.\nYou know what? That’s really it! I hope that now you understand completely how context based question answering chatbots work when using langchain. :)"

You want to create a support channel, so your users can directly ask questions about your offerings, place orders and also return games through this Slack channel.\nNow that we have a well defined problem statement, let’s go about creating a solution using Claudette!\nRecently Answer.AI team released Claudette. It is built on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet - the most powerful language model at the time of writing this blog post.\nAs part of this blog post, I will show you how to use Claudette to create a support bot built on top of Slack. You should be able to easily integrate the steps shown below to respond to user queries by calling any function. Claudette also supports multiple function calls, so you can call a chain of functions to respond to user queries.\nThere are two parts to this blog post.\nFinally, we woll test this out and showcase a demo."

    "section": "1 Creating a slack APP",
    "text": "1 Creating a slack APP\nFor the purpose of this blog post, I created a new workspace on Slack and also created a new app called “support-bot”.\nYou can go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create a new app.\n\n\n\nsupport-bot\n\n\nNext, here’s what you want to do:\n\nEnable socket mode, when you do this, a new APP level token will also be created with scope connections:write.\nGo over to OAuth & Permissions and add the following scopes:\n\napp_mentions:read\nchannels:history\nchannels:read\nchat:write\nim:history\nim:read\nim:write\nreactions:write\n\nEnable event subscriptions.\nInstall your bot to workspace and add it to your support channel.\n\n\n\n\nscopes\n\n\nWe are now ready to start sending messages to public slack channels using our bot. Copy over your SLACK_APP_TOKEN and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN to a .env file and let’s use dotenv to load them.\n\nimport dotenv\n\ndotenv.load_dotenv()\n\nTrue\n\n\nNow let’s make some imports and get our BOT_USER_ID. Each user in Slack has a user_id. To read more about the slack client, refer here.\n\nimport os\nfrom slack_sdk import WebClient\nfrom slack_sdk.errors import SlackApiError\n\n\nclient = WebClient(token=os.environ[\"SLACK_BOT_TOKEN\"])\nBOT_USER_ID = client.auth_test()[\"user_id\"]\nBOT_USER_ID\n\n'U07932L0L5U'\n\n\nYou can also add the channel ID to your dotenv, and we can load it like below:\n\nchannel_id = os.environ['LISTEN_CHANNEL_ID']\nchannel_id\n\n'C078V28044F'\n\n\nTo post the message to your channel, simply use client.chat_postMessage. But, before you do that, make sure to add the support-bot to your channel.\nI created a new channel called #blog and added support-bot to it.\n\nresponse = client.chat_postMessage(\n        channel=channel_id, \n        text=\"Bonjour! My name is Claudia, I am your support-bot for DRAMA77IC, a made-up company name for blogging purposes.\", \n)\n\n\n\n\nweclome-message\n\n\nA little bit more about slack - each message in Slack has a timestamp represented by ts.\n\nmessage = client.conversations_history(channel=channel_id)['messages'][0]\nmessage\n\n{'user': 'U07932L0L5U',\n 'type': 'message',\n 'ts': '1719101633.566529',\n 'bot_id': 'B079C5SV99A',\n 'app_id': 'A079C53DT9A',\n 'text': 'Bonjour! My name is Claudia, I am your support-bot for DRAMA77IC, a made-up company name for blogging purposes.',\n 'team': 'T079C2R49GC',\n 'bot_profile': {'id': 'B079C5SV99A',\n  'deleted': False,\n  'name': 'support-bot',\n  'updated': 1719017903,\n  'app_id': 'A079C53DT9A',\n  'icons': {'image_36': 'https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/plugins/app/bot_36.png',\n   'image_48': 'https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/plugins/app/bot_48.png',\n   'image_72': 'https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/plugins/app/service_72.png'},\n  'team_id': 'T079C2R49GC'},\n 'blocks': [{'type': 'rich_text',\n   'block_id': 'Xwfz',\n   'elements': [{'type': 'rich_text_section',\n     'elements': [{'type': 'text',\n       'text': 'Bonjour! My name is Claudia, I am your support-bot for DRAMA77IC, a made-up company name for blogging purposes.'}]}]}]}\n\n\nTo respond to this very message, we can pass in the timestamp as a thread_ts parameter. This allows to respond to the message in a thread rather than posting a new message on the Slack channel.\n\nresponse = client.chat_postMessage(\n        channel=channel_id, \n        text=\"I was just told to respond to my own message. So I am doing that.\", \n        thread_ts=message['ts']\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nresponse\n\n\nNow we have the basics in place to start working on our support-bot using Claudette.\nEssentially what we want to do is to allow Claude 3.5 Sonnet to talk to the customers a customer support agent. To do that, we want to automate the process of reading new slack messages, sharing them with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, getting a response and posting it back to the user."

Having to convert a function like below:\ndef get_weather(\n    location: str\n):\n    weather_in_celsius = API_CALL(location)\n    return weather_in_celsius\nHaving to convert a simple Python function like above to the required format is rather tedious. Enter claudette!\nClaudette has this function called get_schema that is able to convert a python function to the desired format.|\n\nfrom toolslm.funccall import get_schema\n\ndef get_weather(\n    location: str # The city and state, eg.

San Francisco, CA'}},\n  'required': ['location']}}\n\n\nThis is really handy especially when we want to pass in multiple functions to Claude to choose from.\nAs part of this blog post, let’s demo function calling with a dummy example. This data has been modified from Anthropic’s example here.\nLet’s say the company has the following five games - G1 to G5 and two customers C1 & C2.\n\ncustomers = {\n    \"C1\": dict(name=\"Alice Johnson\", email=\"alice@example.com\", phone=\"123-456-7890\",\n               games=[\"G1\", \"G2\", \"G3\"]),\n    \"C2\": dict(name=\"Bob Smith\", email=\"bob@example.com\", phone=\"987-654-3210\",\n               games=[\"G4\", \"G5\"])\n}\n\ngames = {\n    \"G1\": dict(id=\"G1\", name=\"Shadow Realms\", release_date=\"2023-03-15\", description=\"Navigate enchanted forests and haunted castles.\", status=\"Shipped\"),\n    \"G2\": dict(id=\"G2\", name=\"Solar Winds\", release_date=\"2023-07-22\", description=\"Explore space with stunning visuals and alien planets.\", status=\"Shipped\"),\n    \"G3\": dict(id=\"G3\", name=\"Mystic Legends\", release_date=\"2023-11-10\", description=\"Epic fantasy RPG with beautiful landscapes.\", status=\"Shipped\"),\n    \"G4\": dict(id=\"G4\", name=\"Cyber Revolution\", release_date=\"2024-02-28\", description=\"Dystopian future with advanced technology and cyber warfare.\", status=\"Shipped\"),\n    \"G5\": dict(id=\"G5\", name=\"Desert Storm\", release_date=\"2024-05-05\", description=\"Tactical shooter in a war-torn desert.\", status=\"Processing\")\n}\n\nLet’s now define some functions to get customer information, game information and also return games if needed.\n\ndef get_customer_info(\n    customer_id: str  # ID of the customer\n):  # Customer's name, email, phone number, and list of games\n    \"Retrieves a customer's information and their orders based on the customer ID\"\n    print(f'- Retrieving customer {customer_id}')\n    return customers.get(customer_id, \"Customer not found\")\n\ndef get_game_details(\n    game_id: str  # ID of the game\n):  # Game's ID, name, release date, description & status\n    \"Retrieves the details of a specific game based on the game ID\"\n    print(f'- Retrieving game {game_id}')\n    return games.get(game_id, \"Game not found\")\n\ndef return_game(\n    game_id:str # ID of the order to cancel\n)-&gt;bool: # True if the return is successful\n    \"Returns a game to the cmpany based on game ID.\"\n    print(f'- Returning game {game_id}')\n    if game_id not in games: return False\n    games[game_id]['status'] = 'Returned'\n    return True\n\nNow we can simply define these tools with claudette. Note, as previously mentioned, we no longer need to provide the chunky json version, claudette automatically handles that for us using docments.\n\ntools = [get_customer_info, get_game_details, return_game]\nchat = Chat(model, tools=tools)\n\nLet’s now do a function call as customer C1 and return one of the games.\n\nr = chat('Hi! How are you? This is Alice Johnson. (Customer ID: \"C1\")')\nprint(r.stop_reason)\nr.content\n\nend_turn\n\n\n[TextBlock(text=\"Hello Alice Johnson! It's great to hear from you.

Claudette let’s you call the function automatically by simply calling it again.\n\nr = chat()\nprint(contents(r))\n\nThank you for your patience, Alice. I've retrieved your customer information, including the list of games you currently own. Here's a list of the games associated with your account:\n\n1. Game ID: G1\n2. Game ID: G2\n3. Game ID: G3\n\nThese are the games you currently have in your possession. Would you like more detailed information about any of these games? I can provide you with specific details for each game if you're interested. Just let me know which game(s) you'd like to know more about, and I'll be happy to fetch that information for you.\n\n\n\nr = chat(\"No, that's fine. Can you just return my game G2? I don't want it anymore.\")\nprint(r.stop_reason)\nr.content\n\n- Returning game G2\ntool_use\n\n\n[TextBlock(text=\"Certainly, Alice. I understand that you want to return the game with ID G2.

The return for game G2 has been successfully processed. The system confirms that the return was completed successfully.\n\nTo summarize:\n- You've returned the game with ID G2.\n- The return has been recorded in our system.\n- You should no longer have this game in your possession.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding your games or account? Perhaps you'd like to know more about the remaining games you have, or if you have any other questions, I'm here to assist.\n\n\n\nr = chat(\"That's it. Thank you Claudia.\")\nprint(r.stop_reason)\nr.content\n\nend_turn\n\n\n[TextBlock(text=\"You're welcome, Alice! I'm glad I could help you with returning game G2. \\n\\nJust a small correction: my name isn't Claudia. I'm an AI assistant without a specific name. But I'm always here to help you with any questions or concerns you might have about your games or account.\\n\\nIs there anything else you need assistance with today? If not, I hope you have a wonderful day!\", type='text')]\n\n\nWe can also check the total token use as claudette automatically monitors that for us.\n\n# we can also check the total tokens used in our conversation\nchat.use\n\nIn: 5609; Out: 658; Total: 6267\n\n\nAlso, in the example above we have just returned one game. What if we wanted to return multiple games? We would have to call the return_game function in a loop. This is rather tedious.\nClaudette has a function called toolloop, this allows to call multiple functions (you can define maximum number of multiple function calls) until the model has completed the request. Let’s see it in action.\n\nchat.toolloop(\"Hey Claudia. Can you return all the games for me?\")\n\n- Returning game G1\n- Returning game G3\n\n\nGreat news! I’ve successfully processed the returns for both of your remaining games. Here’s a summary:\n\nGame G1: Successfully returned\nGame G3: Successfully returned\n\nAll of your games have now been returned to the company. Your account should no longer have any active game rentals.\nIs there anything else you would like me to help you with regarding your account or our services?\n\n\nid: msg_01SKrBoyXMbFNUF2uWGFErZK\ncontent: [{‘text’: “Great news!

Now, we were able to call multiple functions in a loop. Which is great. To confirm let’s check the games dict and confirm that the order status has changed.\n\ngames\n\n{'G1': {'id': 'G1',\n  'name': 'Shadow Realms',\n  'release_date': '2023-03-15',\n  'description': 'Navigate enchanted forests and haunted castles.',\n  'status': 'Returned'},\n 'G2': {'id': 'G2',\n  'name': 'Solar Winds',\n  'release_date': '2023-07-22',\n  'description': 'Explore space with stunning visuals and alien planets.',\n  'status': 'Returned'},\n 'G3': {'id': 'G3',\n  'name': 'Mystic Legends',\n  'release_date': '2023-11-10',\n  'description': 'Epic fantasy RPG with beautiful landscapes.',\n  'status': 'Returned'},\n 'G4': {'id': 'G4',\n  'name': 'Cyber Revolution',\n  'release_date': '2024-02-28',\n  'description': 'Dystopian future with advanced technology and cyber warfare.',\n  'status': 'Shipped'},\n 'G5': {'id': 'G5',\n  'name': 'Desert Storm',\n  'release_date': '2024-05-05',\n  'description': 'Tactical shooter in a war-torn desert.',\n  'status': 'Processing'}}\n\n\nAs can be seen from the dictionary above, we can see that games G1, G2 & G3 have been returned.\nNow, that’s a good looking customer support conversation but we want to have this in Slack instead. For that case, we will write a small Python script that constantly monitors the channel and looks for new messages. Claudette only responds if the bot has been mentioned with “(support-bot?)”. Let’s go ahead and write that script now and show it in action."

Because claudette already takes care of state, and past messages, that is something we don’t have to worry about and can simply delegate to Claudette to take care of it all.\nOnce we get a request, we can get a timestamp, and if the user responds in a thread itself, then we get the timestamp from the thread. Next, we extract the message as a string and pass it over to claudette.\nUsing toolloop allows claudette to make function calls directly to Claude and return the answer. A sample conversation on Slack using this setup looks something like below.\n\nThe complete python script can be found in the gist - here."

    "text": "2 Code: Deep-dive\nCalling any class in Python requires the __call__ method to be implemented. LLMChain in itself is a subclass of Chain which has the __call__ method implemented that looks like below:\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/chains/base.py#L185-L250\ndef __call__(\n        self,\n        inputs: Union[Dict[str, Any], Any],\n        return_only_outputs: bool = False,\n        callbacks: Callbacks = None,\n        *,\n        tags: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n        metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,\n        include_run_info: bool = False,\n    ) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:\n        inputs = self.prep_inputs(inputs)\n        callback_manager = CallbackManager.configure(\n            callbacks,\n            self.callbacks,\n            self.verbose,\n            tags,\n            self.tags,\n            metadata,\n            self.metadata,\n        )\n        new_arg_supported = inspect.signature(self._call).parameters.get(\"run_manager\")\n        run_manager = callback_manager.on_chain_start(\n            dumpd(self),\n            inputs,\n        )\n        try:\n            outputs = (\n                self._call(inputs, run_manager=run_manager)\n                if new_arg_supported\n                else self._call(inputs)\n            )\nLooking at the above code we can see that it calls self.prep_inputs(inputs) and then calls self._call method. We wil ignore the self.prep_inputs part for now, as otherwise, this blog post will become too long. The self._call method inside the Chain class is an abstract method. Therefore, it must be implemented in LLMChain.\nLet’s look at the definition of it in LLMChain.\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/chains/llm.py#L87-L93\ndef _call(\n        self,\n        inputs: Dict[str, Any],\n        run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForChainRun] = None,\n    ) -&gt; Dict[str, str]:\n        response = self.generate([inputs], run_manager=run_manager)\n        return self.create_outputs(response)[0]\nOkay, great! Now, we see that the _call method calling self.generate passing in the [inputs]. Remember, the inputs were prepared in self.prep_inputs(inputs) step inside __call__ of Chain.\nBelow I have shared the source code of generate method from LLMChain.\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/chains/llm.py#L95-L107\ndef generate(\n        self,\n        input_list: List[Dict[str, Any]],\n        run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForChainRun] = None,\n    ) -&gt; LLMResult:\n        \"\"\"Generate LLM result from inputs.\"\"\"\n        prompts, stop = self.prep_prompts(input_list, run_manager=run_manager)\n        return self.llm.generate_prompt(\n            prompts,\n            stop,\n            callbacks=run_manager.get_child() if run_manager else None,\n            **self.llm_kwargs,\n        )\nSo, it’s calling self.llm.generate_prompt. Great! At this point, I am starting to wonder, what’s the point of LLMChain at all? Also, let’s skip the self.prep_prompts part. Otherwise the blog post will be too long. Rather than looking at the source code of self.prep_prompts, let’s just look at the output of it.\n&gt;&gt; input_list\n[{'product': 'colorful socks'}]\n\n&gt;&gt; prompts, stop\n([StringPromptValue(text='Tell me a joke that includes colorful socks?')], None)\nSo now all that has happened is that the above code has added product value to out input prompt. Why is this not an f-string I wonder?\nBefore we go any further, because, now we are starting to look at self.llm’s source code and not so much on Chains let’s just look at the reponse from response = self.generate([inputs], run_manager=run_manager). Below is what the response looks like:\n&gt;&gt; response\nLLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='\\n\\nQ: What did the sock say to the other sock when it was feeling blue?\\nA: \"Cheer up, it could be worse, at least we\\'re not white socks!\"', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 9, 'total_tokens': 49, 'completion_tokens': 40}, 'model_name': 'text-davinci-003'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('5afa5d25-802a-49eb-b147-0f708d207a33'))])\nNow we are ready to look into self.llm.generate_prompt, how did this method create the response that we see above?"

    "text": "3 OpenAI LLM\nSo far we were looking at the LLMChain source code. But, internally that in-itself is calling self.llm.generate_prompt. If you remember from the top of the blog post, self.llm was an instance of OpenAI class.\nThe OpenAI class is a subclass of BaseOpenAI and that in itself is a subclass of BaseLLM and the generate_prompt method that was called from inside the generate method of ChainLLM is implemented in BaseLLM. A bit complicated, isn’t it?\n# \n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/llms/base.py#L178-L186\ndef generate_prompt(\n        self,\n        prompts: List[PromptValue],\n        stop: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n        callbacks: Callbacks = None,\n        **kwargs: Any,\n    ) -&gt; LLMResult:\n        prompt_strings = [p.to_string() for p in prompts]\n        return self.generate(prompt_strings, stop=stop, callbacks=callbacks, **kwargs)\nSo, now we can see that the generate_prompt method calls self.generate again. Remember, the last time we called self.generate it was for the LLMChain, but this time, it is for the OpenAI LLM. The p.to_string() part? That’s just converting our prompt to string. This is the output of prompt_strings looks like below:\n&gt;&gt; prompt_strings\n['Tell me a joke that includes colorful socks?']\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n🤔 So far so good? Yes and No. I am a bit baffled at the amount of complexity in the code. I still don’t know why we had a Chain and a LLMChain. I guess we are looking at just one use-case of LLMChain which is generation, LLMChains might also be supporting other use cases where this complexity might be needed.\n\n\nTime to look at the generate method. It is again implemented in BaseLLM.\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/llms/base.py#L233-L302\ndef generate(\n        self,\n        prompts: List[str],\n        stop: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n        callbacks: Callbacks = None,\n        *,\n        tags: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n        metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,\n        **kwargs: Any,\n    ) -&gt; LLMResult:\n        \"\"\"Run the LLM on the given prompt and input.\"\"\"\n        if not isinstance(prompts, list):\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"Argument 'prompts' is expected to be of type List[str], received\"\n                f\" argument of type {type(prompts)}.\"\n            )\n        params = self.dict()\n        params[\"stop\"] = stop\n        options = {\"stop\": stop}\n        (\n            existing_prompts,\n            llm_string,\n            missing_prompt_idxs,\n            missing_prompts,\n        ) = get_prompts(params, prompts)\n        disregard_cache = self.cache is not None and not self.cache\n        callback_manager = CallbackManager.configure(\n            callbacks,\n            self.callbacks,\n            self.verbose,\n            tags,\n            self.tags,\n            metadata,\n            self.metadata,\n        )\n        new_arg_supported = inspect.signature(self._generate).parameters.get(\n            \"run_manager\"\n        )\n        if langchain.llm_cache is None or disregard_cache:\n            if self.cache is not None and self.cache:\n                raise ValueError(\n                    \"Asked to cache, but no cache found at `langchain.cache`.\"\n                )\n            run_managers = callback_manager.on_llm_start(\n                dumpd(self), prompts, invocation_params=params, options=options\n            )\n            output = self._generate_helper(\n                prompts, stop, run_managers, bool(new_arg_supported), **kwargs\n            )\n            return output\n        if len(missing_prompts) &gt; 0:\n            run_managers = callback_manager.on_llm_start(\n                dumpd(self), missing_prompts, invocation_params=params, options=options\n            )\n            new_results = self._generate_helper(\n                missing_prompts, stop, run_managers, bool(new_arg_supported), **kwargs\n            )\n            llm_output = update_cache(\n                existing_prompts, llm_string, missing_prompt_idxs, new_results, prompts\n            )\n            run_info = (\n                [RunInfo(run_id=run_manager.run_id) for run_manager in run_managers]\n                if run_managers\n                else None\n            )\n        else:\n            llm_output = {}\n            run_info = None\n        generations = [existing_prompts[i] for i in range(len(prompts))]\n        return LLMResult(generations=generations, llm_output=llm_output, run=run_info)\nOkay, well, let’s look at the outputs step-by-step. This again is a majorly over-complicated piece of code. But, for what? Why do we need such complication?\n&gt;&gt; params\n{'model_name': 'text-davinci-003', 'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 256, 'top_p': 1, 'frequency_penalty': 0, 'presence_penalty': 0, 'n': 1, 'request_timeout': None, 'logit_bias': {}, '_type': 'openai', 'stop': None}\nHonestly, looking at the above source code, I am still a bit confused at which point do we even call the model and call the create API. I can’t count how many layers down we are in code, and we still haven’t called the openai.Completion.create method when generating an output from the prompt should be as simple as:\nimport openai\n\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n  model=\"text-davinci-003\",\n  prompt=\"Write a tagline for an ice cream shop.\"\n)\nI believe the part where the generations actually happen is inside the following piece of code.\noutput = self._generate_helper(\n                prompts, stop, run_managers, bool(new_arg_supported), **kwargs\n            )\n\n# Values of `output` (This is the same as `response` from before)\n&gt;&gt; output\nLLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='\\n\\nQ: What did the sock say to the other sock when it was feeling blue?\\nA: \"Cheer up, it could be worse, at least we\\'re not white socks!\"', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 9, 'total_tokens': 49, 'completion_tokens': 40}, 'model_name': 'text-davinci-003'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('b32869ec-43a3-4780-805e-be482f1fe05b'))])\nSo, now we need to look at another method self._generate_helper and who knows what other methods that method will call. Let’s dig down more into the source code a bit further and look at self._generate_helper.\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/llms/base.py#L200-L231\ndef _generate_helper(\n        self,\n        prompts: List[str],\n        stop: Optional[List[str]],\n        run_managers: List[CallbackManagerForLLMRun],\n        new_arg_supported: bool,\n        **kwargs: Any,\n    ) -&gt; LLMResult:\n        try:\n            output = (\n                self._generate(\n                    prompts,\n                    stop=stop,\n                    # TODO: support multiple run managers\n                    run_manager=run_managers[0] if run_managers else None,\n                    **kwargs,\n                )\n                if new_arg_supported\n                else self._generate(prompts, stop=stop)\n            )\n        except (KeyboardInterrupt, Exception) as e:\n            for run_manager in run_managers:\n                run_manager.on_llm_error(e)\n            raise e\n        flattened_outputs = output.flatten()\n        for manager, flattened_output in zip(run_managers, flattened_outputs):\n            manager.on_llm_end(flattened_output)\n        if run_managers:\n            output.run = [\n                RunInfo(run_id=run_manager.run_id) for run_manager in run_managers\n            ]\n        return output\nUnbelievable! The self._generate_helper is further calling self._generate method which is an abstract method in BaseLLM but implemented in BaseOpenAI!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n😡 Are you still with me yet? We got to finish this. But, yes I am a bit frustrated. This whole part seems so complex and is so hard to follow and explain. Let’s recap what has happened so far. We wanted to look at what goes inside LangChain to create outputs from a prompt. What we have discovered is extremely puzzling. And I am being euphemistic here.\nWe started with LLMChain and called it using __call__ method that was implemented in Chain which called_call method of LLMChain that in-turn called self.generate which further called self.llm.generate_prompt.\nself.llm is an instance of OpenAI class which is subclass of BaseOpenAI which is subclass of BaseLLM and generate_prompt method is implemented there. We are not done yet.\nThe generate_prompt implemented in BaseLLM calls self.generate which in turn calls self._generate_helper that in turn calls self._generate of BaseOpenAI!\nIsn’t that a lot of code? And we still haven’t called the OpenAI API yet.\n\n\nOkay, I am normally breathing again. Let’s continue. We are still not done yet and haven’t generated our results. Let’s continue and look at the self._generate method which is implemented in BaseOpenAI.\n# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/24c165420827305e813f4b6d501f93d18f6d46a4/langchain/llms/openai.py#L272-L325\ndef _generate(\n        self,\n        prompts: List[str],\n        stop: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n        run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForLLMRun] = None,\n        **kwargs: Any,\n    ) -&gt; LLMResult:\n        params = self._invocation_params\n        params = {**params, **kwargs}\n        sub_prompts = self.get_sub_prompts(params, prompts, stop)\n        choices = []\n        token_usage: Dict[str, int] = {}\n        # Get the token usage from the response.\n        # Includes prompt, completion, and total tokens used.\n        _keys = {\"completion_tokens\", \"prompt_tokens\", \"total_tokens\"}\n        for _prompts in sub_prompts:\n            if self.streaming:\n                if len(_prompts) &gt; 1:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Cannot stream results with multiple prompts.\")\n                params[\"stream\"] = True\n                response = _streaming_response_template()\n                for stream_resp in completion_with_retry(\n                    self, prompt=_prompts, **params\n                ):\n                    if run_manager:\n                        run_manager.on_llm_new_token(\n                            stream_resp[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"],\n                            verbose=self.verbose,\n                            logprobs=stream_resp[\"choices\"][0][\"logprobs\"],\n                        )\n                    _update_response(response, stream_resp)\n                choices.extend(response[\"choices\"])\n            else:\n                response = completion_with_retry(self, prompt=_prompts, **params)\n                choices.extend(response[\"choices\"])\n            if not self.streaming:\n                # Can't update token usage if streaming\n                update_token_usage(_keys, response, token_usage)\n        return self.create_llm_result(choices, prompts, token_usage)\nDo we get to the part where we have results yet? Yes! The completion_with_retry function looks like it! Let’s look at the inputs to this function.

The _prompts is just the Prompt Template converted to a string.

    "text": "4 Complexity and Readability in LangChain\nGoing through the LangChain code, I find myself filled with a mix of admiration and confusion. It’s clear that the creators of LangChain put a lot of thought into building a flexible architecture. The design, which involves multiple layers of abstraction and many separate components, suggests that the tool is built to handle a wide range of use cases beyond the one we’ve examined today. However, in this particular scenario, we’ve seen how complexity can make code harder to follow and understand.\nLet’s start with the positives. The modular design of LangChain allows for easy extension and modification.\nOn the other hand, the complexity of the code made it difficult to trace the flow of execution. We found ourselves diving deeper and deeper into the call stack, and it took a considerable amount of time just to locate the point where the OpenAI API is actually called.\nAnother point of confusion was the usage of the self.dict() method. It seems that this method is intended to create a dictionary representation of an object’s attributes, but it’s not immediately clear why this is necessary. In some cases, it seemed that a simpler approach, such as using f-strings for prompt generation, could have achieved the same result with less code.\nIn conclusion, examining the LangChain code has provided valuable insights into the design decisions that go into creating a complex tool like this. While the abstraction and modularity are commendable, the complexity of the code can potentially make it harder for anyone to understand.\nWhat are your thoughts?"

It is built on top of gradio.\nAs part of this demo, we are able to retrieve images based on the following filters:\n\nCaption (description of the image)\nBrightness (brightness in the image, lower represents a darker image)\nNumber of items (lower represents fewer number of items in the image)\n\nStarting with a 5/255 brightness & a 5/50 items per image for dining room, we were able to retrieve an almost empty & dark image of a dining room.\nIncreasing the number of items to 50 retrieves a dark image of a dining room but with chairs and a dining table.\nAs you’ll later see, we can also add a lot more filters such as an input image, image segmentation mask, image boundary, number of humans and more but we have limited ourselves to three for the purpose of this demo.\n\nWith this understanding of the demo app, let’s get started and build one ourselves!

    "text": "2.3 4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling\nLet’s start digging into the paper first and understand more about the 4M-21 paper. It is the second in the 4M series by apple. The first paper 4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling was released in Dec 2023.\nFrom the paper: &gt; To enable training a single Transformer on modalities with different formats, like text, bounding boxes, images, or neural network features, we choose to unify their representational spaces by mapping them into sets or sequences of discrete tokens using modality-specific tokenizers. This tokenization approach enhances compatibility, scalability, and sharing by removing the need for task-specific encoders and heads, allowing the Transformer to be compatible with all modalities and maintain full parameter-sharing.\nAlso from the paper: &gt; All modalities are mapped to sets or sequences of discrete tokens (indices of a vocabulary) through the use of modality-specific tokenizers. Captions and bounding boxes are both treated as text and encoded using WordPiece. For modeling bounding boxes, we follow the approach of Pix2Seq, that turns the task of object detection into a sequence prediction problem. RGB, depth, normals, semantic segmentation maps, and CLIP feature maps are tokenized using learned vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE)\nTo say it in simple words - using modality specific tokenizers (for example, WordPiece for text inputs & VQ-VAE for feature maps), the authors found a way to make all modalities be represented in a single unified space. Once all inputs could be mapped to a unified space, then the encoder-decoder transformer was trained on top to perform any-to-any prediction using pre-training strategy similar to Multi-MAE.\n\n\n\nsupport-bot\n\n\nThe training can be visualised in the image above. First, modality specific tokenizers are utilised to map input modalities such as RGB, Segmentation, CLIP Features to a specific number of tokens.\nNext, select at random a specific number of input tokens (this is defined by parameter α, that defines proportion of tokens input & output tokens per modality), and use the random sample of input tokens to predict a random sample of output tokens in an auto-regressive manner using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.\nOne thing you might ask:\nWhat happens if our target modalities increase? The authors decided to mask targets also and only predict a certain number of targets for randomly sampled input tokens. This allows training on multiple modalities while keeping the training costs low.\nBy training this way, the model learns how to predict target modalities given some number of input modalities. This is what we want to achieve our goal.\nGiven an input decsription of the image, and maybe a colour palette, we want to find the most similar images in our dataset. (Thus, given text & colour pallete as input modalities, we want to predict RGB pixels as output modality and use this to find similar images)\nLet’s see this in action with the help of code. All code, models and tokenizers have been open-sourced here."

    "text": "3 Data download using img2dataset and preparation using webdataset\nBefore we can start training any models, we need data. In this part of the blog post we are looking at data preparation part of CLIP. Remember, that CLIP was trained on 400M (image, text) pairs.\nFrom the paper:\nWe create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs and demonstrate that a simplified version of ConVIRT trained from scratch, which we call CLIP, for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, is an efficient method of learning from natural language supervision.\nSo, how does one create these image text pairs in practice? One of the easiest ways to train CLIP using Open CLIP is to generate the dataset in the form of webdataset using img2dataset.\nWe will only be creating a tiny version consisting of only 1,000 (image, text) and not the complete 400M dataset used in CLIP.\n\n\nCode\n%%time\n# !pip install img2dataset \nfrom img2dataset import download\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\noutput_dir = os.path.abspath(\"sample\")\n\nif os.path.exists(output_dir):\n    shutil.rmtree(output_dir)\n\ndownload(\n    processes_count=os.cpu_count(),\n    thread_count=os.cpu_count()*2,\n    url_list=\"/home/ubuntu/GIT_REPOS/data/img2dataset/tests/test_files/test_1000.parquet\",\n    image_size=256,\n    output_folder=output_dir,\n    output_format=\"webdataset\",\n    input_format=\"parquet\",\n    url_col=\"URL\",\n    caption_col=\"TEXT\",\n    enable_wandb=False,\n    number_sample_per_shard=100, \n    distributor=\"multiprocessing\",\n)\n\n\nStarting the downloading of this file\nSharding file number 1 of 1 called /home/ubuntu/GIT_REPOS/data/img2dataset/tests/test_files/test_1000.parquet\n\n\n0it [00:00, ?it/s]\n\n\n\nFile sharded in 10 shards\nDownloading starting now, check your bandwidth speed (with bwm-ng)your cpu (with htop), and your disk usage (with iotop)!\n\n\n10it [00:31,  3.19s/it]\n\n\nworker  - success: 0.840 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 12 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.840 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 12 - count: 100\nworker  - success: 0.850 - failed to download: 0.140 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 12 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.845 - failed to download: 0.145 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 23 - count: 200\nworker  - success: 0.850 - failed to download: 0.140 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 8 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.847 - failed to download: 0.143 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 23 - count: 300\nworker  - success: 0.850 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.000 - images per sec: 9 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.848 - failed to download: 0.145 - failed to resize: 0.007 - images per sec: 30 - count: 400\nworker  - success: 0.840 - failed to download: 0.160 - failed to resize: 0.000 - images per sec: 10 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.846 - failed to download: 0.148 - failed to resize: 0.006 - images per sec: 38 - count: 500\nworker  - success: 0.830 - failed to download: 0.160 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 10 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.843 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.007 - images per sec: 31 - count: 600\nworker  - success: 0.830 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.020 - images per sec: 9 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.841 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.009 - images per sec: 35 - count: 700\nworker  - success: 0.880 - failed to download: 0.100 - failed to resize: 0.020 - images per sec: 6 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.846 - failed to download: 0.144 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 40 - count: 800\nworker  - success: 0.840 - failed to download: 0.150 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 4 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.846 - failed to download: 0.144 - failed to resize: 0.010 - images per sec: 34 - count: 900\nworker  - success: 0.900 - failed to download: 0.100 - failed to resize: 0.000 - images per sec: 4 - count: 100\ntotal   - success: 0.851 - failed to download: 0.140 - failed to resize: 0.009 - images per sec: 38 - count: 1000\nCPU times: user 71.6 ms, sys: 51 ms, total: 123 ms\nWall time: 32.6 s\n\n\nSo it takes ~35 seconds to create the tiny dataset on my 8 core machine. Please refer to img2dataset for information on other available (image, text) pair datasets.\nBut, what do the downloads look like? Let’s find out.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nnp.array(sorted(list(Path('./sample/').glob('*tar'))))\n\n\narray([PosixPath('sample/00000.tar'), PosixPath('sample/00001.tar'),\n       PosixPath('sample/00002.tar'), PosixPath('sample/00003.tar'),\n       PosixPath('sample/00004.tar'), PosixPath('sample/00005.tar'),\n       PosixPath('sample/00006.tar'), PosixPath('sample/00007.tar'),\n       PosixPath('sample/00008.tar'), PosixPath('sample/00009.tar')],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\nAs we can see above, the script from img2dataset downloads {00000...00009).tar files. What’s in these .tar files? Answer lies in the documentation of webdataset. I won’t be covering more details as part of this blog post as we have a lot to cover stil!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nOne key thing that I haven’t covered as part of this blog post, is that how do these .tar files get converted to inputs to the CLIP model? Let me share briefly here and point to the right directions.\nFirst, a data pipeline is created using wds (webdataset) package. You can find the pipeline being created here.\nThis pipeline takes in a tokenizer that’s HFTokenizer, see here. This HFTokenizer tokenizes the input and returns input_ids of context_length = 77."

    "text": "5 CLIP Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Summary of CLIP approach\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 2, we can see that we have a text encoder and image encoder. These encoders are responsible for taking in the image and the text and and converting them to an embedding space.\nAs mentioned in Section 1, we will assume that there is some magic function that can read the .tar files and return tensors of shape [1, 3, 224, 224] for each image, and [1, 77], for each text.\nThese inputs then get encoded to embedding space using image and text encoder respectively.\nThe image encoder encodes images to embeddings \\(I_1, I_2, I_2 ... I_N\\), and the text encoder encodes respective image captions to \\(T_1, T_2, T_3 ... T_N\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn practice, the embedding size in CLIP is 1024. Therefore is our batch size \\(N = 8\\), the 8 input images will get encoded to a tensor of shape \\((8, 1024)\\), and also the 8 input texts will get encoded to a tensor of shape \\((8, 1024)\\).\n\n\nLet’s start by looking at the inputs and outputs of the overall CLIP model.\nFirst, we load the config, as part of this blog post we will work with ResNet-50 architecture as an example. So, let’s start by loading the corresponding config.\n\n\nCode\nimport json, torch\nfrom open_clip.model import CLIP\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwith open('../../open_clip/src/open_clip/model_configs/RN50.json') as o:\n    cfg = json.load(o)\ncfg\n\n\n{'embed_dim': 1024,\n 'vision_cfg': {'image_size': 224,\n  'layers': [3, 4, 6, 3],\n  'width': 64,\n  'patch_size': None},\n 'text_cfg': {'context_length': 77,\n  'vocab_size': 49408,\n  'width': 512,\n  'heads': 8,\n  'layers': 12}}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\nmodel = CLIP(**cfg).to(device)\nimage = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)\ntext  = torch.randint(low=0, high=cfg['text_cfg']['vocab_size'], size=(1, 77)).to(device)\nimage_features, text_features, logit_scale   = model(image, text)\nimage_features.shape, text_features.shape, logit_scale\n\n\n(torch.Size([1, 1024]),\n torch.Size([1, 1024]),\n tensor(14.2857, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=&lt;ExpBackward0&gt;))\n\n\nAs can be seen above, the model expects image and text as inputs where in this case:\nimage = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)\ntext  = torch.randint(low=0, high=cfg['text_cfg']['vocab_size'], size=(1, 77)).to(device)\nYou might recognize image shape easily - it represents 1 image with 3 channels (RGB) and (H,W) = 224. For text, each text is tokenized to max length 77. The integer numbers represent token_id with max value of cfg['text_cfg']['vocab_size'].\nMakes sense so far?\nAs for the outputs, the model returns three outputs - image_features, text_features and logit_scale.\nlogit_scale has been covered in more detail in Section 8 of this blog post. For now, think of it as a learnable parameter during model training.\nAs for image_features & text_features, these are the respective embeddings \\(I_1, I_2, I_2 ... I_N\\), and the text encoder encodes respective image captions to \\(T_1, T_2, T_3 ... T_N\\) with reference to Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you proceed further, remember, the encoders are responsible for encoding the input image and text to embeddings of dimension - \\(1024\\).\nWe could have also done something like:\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\nmodel = CLIP(**cfg).to(device)\nimage = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)\ntext  = torch.randint(low=0, high=cfg['text_cfg']['vocab_size'], size=(1, 77)).to(device)\nimage_features = model.encode_image(image)\ntext_features = model.encode_text(text)\n\n\nNext, let’s look at the respective architectures of Image and Text encoders in more detail."

    "text": "6 Image Encoder\nFrom the paper:\nWe consider two different architectures for the image encoder. For the first, we use ResNet-50 (K. He et al. (2015)) as the base architecture for the image encoder due to its widespread adoption and proven performance. We make several modifications to the original version using the ResNetD improvements from T. He et al. (2018) and the antialiased rect-2 blur pooling from Zhang (2019). We also replace the global average pooling layer with an attention pooling mechanism. The attention pooling is implemented as a single layer of “transformer-style” multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image. For the second architecture, we experiment with the recently introduced Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)). We closely follow their implementation with only the minor modification of adding an additional layer normalization to the combined patch and position embeddings before the transformer and use a slightly different initialization scheme.\n\n6.1 Modified ResNet\nLet’s start with the first architecture.\nFor the first, we use ResNet-50 (K. He et al. (2015)) as the base architecture for the image encoder due to its widespread adoption and proven performance. We make several modifications to the original version using the ResNetD improvements from T. He et al. (2018) and the antialiased rect-2 blur pooling from Zhang (2019). We also replace the global average pooling layer with an attention pooling mechanism. The attention pooling is implemented as a single layer of “transformer-style” multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image.\nHe, Kaiming, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. 2015. “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.” CoRR abs/1512.03385. http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385.\n\nThere are 3 major changes as mentioned to the ResNet architecture in CLIP:\n\nThere are now 3 “stem” convolutions as opposed to 1, with an average pool instead of a max pool.\nPerforms anti-aliasing strided convolutions, where an avgpool is prepended to convolutions with stride &gt; 1\nThe final pooling layer is a QKV attention instead of an average pool\n\n\n6.1.1 ResNet stem\nLet’s look at all of them one by one in code. First, we start with There are now 3 “stem” convolutions as opposed to 1, with an average pool instead of a max pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Overview of ResNet architecture\n\n\n\nIn the vanilla ResNet architecture, the stem consists of a 7x7 stride-2 convolution. This is what the stem looks like in the vanilla ResNet architecture.\nclass VanillaResNet:\n    def __init__(...):\n        self.stem = nn.Conv2d(in_chans, inplanes, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3, bias=False)\nHowever, in the paper T. He et al. (2018), where at the time, the authors raised ResNet-50’s top-1 validation accuracy from 75.3% to 79.29% on ImageNet. From the paper, one of the tweaks used in the architecture:\nA 7 × 7 convolution is 5.4 times more expensive than a 3 × 3 convolution. So this tweak replacing the 7 × 7 convolution in the input stem with three conservative 3 × 3 convolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Overview of ResNet tweak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOn top of replacing \\(7x7\\) stride-2 convolution with 3 consecutive \\(3x3\\) convolutions, the authors also replaced max pooling with average pooling, but image above shows max pooling as it has been directly copied from T. He et al. (2018).\n\n\n\nHe, Tong, Zhi Zhang, Hang Zhang, Zhongyue Zhang, Junyuan Xie, and Mu Li. 2018. “Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks.” CoRR abs/1812.01187. http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187.\nIn code this looks like:\nclass ModifiedResNet:\n    def __init__(...):\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, width // 2, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False)\n        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(width // 2)\n        self.act1 = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(width // 2, width // 2, kernel_size=3, padding=1, bias=False)\n        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(width // 2)\n        self.act2 = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)\n        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(width // 2, width, kernel_size=3, padding=1, bias=False)\n        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm2d(width)\n        self.act3 = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)\n        self.avgpool = nn.AvgPool2d(2)\n\n\n    def stem(self, x):\n        x = self.act1(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))\n        x = self.act2(self.bn2(self.conv2(x)))\n        x = self.act3(self.bn3(self.conv3(x)))\n        x = self.avgpool(x)\n        return x\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.stem(x)\n\n\n6.1.2 Blur Pool\nThe next change is to use BlurPooling - Performs anti-aliasing strided convolutions, where an avgpool is prepended to convolutions with stride &gt; 1. This change has been adopted from Zhang (2019).\nIn this section I will introduce BlurPooling and share how it is implemented in the ModifiedResNet architecture.\n\n\nFrom the research paper,\nModern convolutional networks are not shiftinvariant, as small input shifts or translations can cause drastic changes in the output. Commonly used downsampling methods, such as max-pooling, strided-convolution, and averagepooling, ignore the sampling theorem. The wellknown signal processing fix is anti-aliasing by low-pass filtering before downsampling.\nBlur Pooling in CLIP has been implemented inside the Bottleneck block as below:\n\nclass Bottleneck(nn.Module):\n    expansion = 4\n\n    def __init__(self, inplanes, planes, stride=1):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.stem = create_stem() # stem consists of 3 3x3 convs instead of 1 7x7 stride-2 conv\n        self.downsample = None\n        self.stride = stride\n        if stride &gt; 1 or inplanes != planes * Bottleneck.expansion:\n            # downsampling layer is prepended with an avgpool, and the subsequent convolution has stride 1\n            self.downsample = nn.Sequential(OrderedDict([\n                (\"-1\", nn.AvgPool2d(stride)),\n                (\"0\", nn.Conv2d(inplanes, planes * self.expansion, 1, stride=1, bias=False)),\n                (\"1\", nn.BatchNorm2d(planes * self.expansion))\n            ]))\n\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):\n        identity = x\n        out = self.stem()\n        if self.downsample is not None:\n            identity = self.downsample(x)\n\n        out += identity\n        out = self.act3(out)\n        return out\nNow the blurring occurs in downsample. Previously, as can be seen in Figure 3, this downsample layer would be a stride-2 \\(1x1\\) convolution.\nIn ModifiedResnet, this downsample consists of:\nself.downsample = nn.Sequential(OrderedDict([\n        (\"-1\", nn.AvgPool2d(stride)),\n        (\"0\", nn.Conv2d(inplanes, planes * self.expansion, 1, stride=1, bias=False)),\n        (\"1\", nn.BatchNorm2d(planes * self.expansion))\n    ]))\nWhere, the convolution is stride-1.\nThe blurring occurs in nn.AvgPool2d(stride). How? See example below:\n\n\nCode\nimport torch.nn as nn \nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np \nimport torch\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npool = nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2)\nimg  = np.array(Image.open('../images/clip.png'))\nx    = torch.tensor(img, dtype=torch.float64).permute(2, 0, 1)\nout  = pool(pool(x))\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 8))\nax[0].imshow(x.int().permute(1,2,0))\nax[0].set_title(\"Input image before average pooling\");\nax[1].imshow(out.int().permute(1,2,0))\nax[1].set_title(\"Input image after average pooling\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen above, passing the input image through a nn.AvgPool2d blurs the image, and therefore, anti-aliases the input as per Zhang (2019). As a result, the resulting model is translation invariant.\n\nZhang, Richard. 2019. “Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again.” CoRR abs/1904.11486. http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11486.\n\n\n6.1.3 Final pooling layer\nThis brings us to the final change in ModifiedResnet.\nThe last change in the network architecture is to use QKV attention instead of an average pool. From the paper:\nWe also replace the global average pooling layer with an attention pooling mechanism. The attention pooling is implemented as a single layer of “transformer-style” multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image.\n\n\nCode\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass AttentionPool2d(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, spacial_dim: int, embed_dim: int, num_heads: int, output_dim: int = None):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.positional_embedding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(spacial_dim ** 2 + 1, embed_dim) / embed_dim ** 0.5)\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, output_dim or embed_dim)\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = x.reshape(x.shape[0], x.shape[1], x.shape[2] * x.shape[3]).permute(2, 0, 1)  # NCHW -&gt; (HW)NC\n        x = torch.cat([x.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True), x], dim=0)  # (HW+1)NC\n        x = x + self.positional_embedding[:, None, :].to(x.dtype)  # (HW+1)NC\n        x, _ = F.multi_head_attention_forward(\n            query=x, key=x, value=x,\n            embed_dim_to_check=x.shape[-1],\n            num_heads=self.num_heads,\n            q_proj_weight=self.q_proj.weight,\n            k_proj_weight=self.k_proj.weight,\n            v_proj_weight=self.v_proj.weight,\n            in_proj_weight=None,\n            in_proj_bias=torch.cat([self.q_proj.bias, self.k_proj.bias, self.v_proj.bias]),\n            bias_k=None,\n            bias_v=None,\n            add_zero_attn=False,\n            dropout_p=0.,\n            out_proj_weight=self.c_proj.weight,\n            out_proj_bias=self.c_proj.bias,\n            use_separate_proj_weight=True,\n            training=self.training,\n            need_weights=False\n        )\n\n        return x[0]\n\n\nAs can be seen from the code above, we perform multi head self-attention from Vaswani et al. (2017), on x. One key thing to note above in the forward method is :\nx = torch.cat([x.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True), x], dim=0)  # (HW+1)NC\nThis corresponds to “query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image” from the paper because the final output that is returned is x[0] and x[0] is global average pooled representation of the image.\n\n\n\n6.2 Modified ViT\nFrom the paper:\nFor the second architecture, we experiment with the recently introduced Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)). We closely follow their implementation with only the minor modification of adding an additional layer normalization to the combined patch and position embeddings before the transformer and use a slightly different initialization scheme.\nDosovitskiy, Alexey, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, et al. 2020. “An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale.” CoRR abs/2010.11929. https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929.\n\nSince the architecture is very similar to vanilla Vision Transformer, with a very minor change of adding LayerNorm after combining Patch embeddings and positional embeddings, I will not be covering the architecture in detail in this blog post.\nFor reference to ViT, please refer to my previous blog post that covers the architecture in detail with PyTorch code implementation - Vision Transformer\nHaving covered both Image encoders used in CLIP architecture, it is now time to move on to the text encoder."

    "text": "7 Text Encoder\nIn this section, let’s look at the text encoder of CLIP architecture. From the paper:\nThe text encoder is a Transformer (Vaswani et al. (2017)) with the architecture modifications described in Radford et al. (2019). As a base size we use a 63M-parameter 12layer 512-wide model with 8 attention heads. The transformer operates on a lower-cased byte pair encoding (BPE) representation of the text with a 49,152 vocab size (Sennrich et al., 2015). For computational efficiency, the max sequence length was capped at 76. The text sequence is bracketed with [SOS] and [EOS] tokens and the activations of the highest layer of the transformer at the [EOS] token are treated as the feature representation of the text which is layer normalized and then linearly projected into the multi-modal embedding space. Masked self-attention was used in the text encoder to preserve the ability to initialize with a pre-trained language model or add language modeling as an auxiliary objective, though exploration of this is left as future work.\nVaswani, Ashish, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. 2017. “Attention Is All You Need.” CoRR abs/1706.03762. http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762.\n\nI have previously covered the complete GPT-2 architecture used as text encoder in my previous blog post at The annotated GPT-2 and therefore, won’t be covering it here in this blog post."

    "section": "8 Contrastive Loss",
    "text": "8 Contrastive Loss\nOne thing that I was most interested in when I started to write the CLIP blog post was to look at Contrastive Loss and understand it in PyTorch code.\nIn this section, that is exactly what we will be doing.\nIf you remember from Section 6, the images get encoded as image features to shape torch.Size([16, 1024]) and texts get encoded to text features of shape torch.Size([16, 1024]).\nLet’s look at the inputs and outputs of ClipLoss before implementing ourselves.\n\n\nCode\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport numpy as np \nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom open_clip.loss import ClipLoss\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimage_features = torch.randn(16, 1024)\ntext_features  = torch.randn(16, 1024)\nloss_fn        = ClipLoss()\nlogit_scale    = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(np.log(1/0.07)))\nloss = loss_fn(image_features, text_features, logit_scale)\nloss\n\n\ntensor(134.1310, grad_fn=&lt;DivBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nOne thing you’ll notice is that the ClipLoss expects a parameter called logit_scale. Now, what is this logit_scale parameter?\nFrom the paper:\nThe learnable temperature parameter \\(τ\\) was initialized to the equivalent of 0.07 from (Veeling et al. (2018)) and clipped to prevent scaling the logits by more than 100 which we found necessary to prevent training instability.\nVeeling, Bastiaan S., Jasper Linmans, Jim Winkens, Taco Cohen, and Max Welling. 2018. “Rotation Equivariant CNNs for Digital Pathology.” https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.1806.03962.\n\nBut, rather than being initialised to \\(0.07\\), this temperature parameter \\(τ\\) get’s initialized as nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(np.log(1/0.07))). For further explanation, see this issue here.\nNow, having looked at the inputs and outputs and also logit_scale, it is time to look at the source code. Remember contrastive loss and what it does from part-1 of the blog post? As a quick revision, let me re-post the image here too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Cosine similarity between text and image features\n\n\n\nContrastive loss is trying to maximise the cosine similarity on the diagonal and minimise it elsewhere. But, how? In pseudo-code this looked something like:\n# symmetric loss function \nlabels = np.arange(n) \nloss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0) \nloss_t = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=1) \nloss = (loss_i + loss_t)/2\nOnce, we have logits, which is the \\(8 x 8\\) matrix as in Figure 5 above, we calculate Cross Entropy Loss once for axis=0 and once for axis=1, this way, we are trying to match the diagonal to corresponding image and text because the labels are aligned on both the axis.\nBut, how does this look like in code? Let’s see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe below implementation of ClipLoss is a minimalistic version of the complete implementation from open clip.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass ClipLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n            self,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def get_ground_truth(self, device, num_logits) -&gt; torch.Tensor:\n        labels = torch.arange(num_logits, device=device, dtype=torch.long)\n        return labels\n\n    def get_logits(self, image_features, text_features, logit_scale):\n        logits_per_image = logit_scale * image_features @ text_features.T\n        logits_per_text = logit_scale * text_features @ image_features.T        \n        return logits_per_image, logits_per_text\n\n    def forward(self, image_features, text_features, logit_scale, output_dict=False):\n        device = image_features.device\n        logits_per_image, logits_per_text = self.get_logits(image_features, text_features, logit_scale)\n        labels = self.get_ground_truth(device, logits_per_image.shape[0])\n        total_loss = (\n            F.cross_entropy(logits_per_image, labels) +\n            F.cross_entropy(logits_per_text, labels)\n        ) / 2\n        return {\"contrastive_loss\": total_loss}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimage_features = torch.randn(16, 1024)\ntext_features  = torch.randn(16, 1024)\nloss_fn        = ClipLoss()\nlogit_scale    = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(np.log(1/0.07)))\nloss = loss_fn(image_features, text_features, logit_scale)\nloss\n\n\n{'contrastive_loss': tensor(140.2225, grad_fn=&lt;DivBackward0&gt;)}\n\n\nSo, how does the above implementation match pseudo-code?\nLet’s start with labels. Since the labels are aligned, that is the \\(0th\\) image on axis=0 corresponds to \\(0th\\) text on axis=1, therefore, we can just say that labels = torch.arange(num_logits, device=device, dtype=torch.long). In this case the value of labels comes out to be tensor([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7], device='cuda:0') based on Figure 5. By minimising Cross Entropy loss for these labels once for axis=0 and once for axis=1, we are making sure that cosine-similarity on the diagonal is maximum and lower otherwise.\nIn code (as opposed to pseudo-code), rather than minimising cross entropy for axis=0, and axis=1, we calculate:\n    logits_per_image = logit_scale * image_features @ text_features.T\n    logits_per_text = logit_scale * text_features @ image_features.T    \nThis is same as calculating logits once for axis=1, and once for axis=0, therefore, our total loss is:\n    total_loss = (\n        F.cross_entropy(logits_per_image, labels) +\n        F.cross_entropy(logits_per_text, labels)\n    ) / 2\nThis is equivalent to pseudo code from paper:\n    labels = np.arange(n) \n    loss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0) \n    loss_t = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=1) \n    loss = (loss_i + loss_t)/2"

The query consist of one or more modalities from Figure 2. As part of this blog post, we will be focusing on the “caption + metadata -&gt; RGB” retrieval example.\nIn Figure 4, given the inputs “a fancy mansion” and “brightness 200/255”, the model was able to return very bright images of a mansion. Doing the same for “brightness 30/255” returns darker images of mansions. We will be replicating this functionality as part of this blog post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFigure 4 above is what prompted the idea for this blog post. What if we can utilise some or all of the modalities to query our own custom databases?\nThank you dear authors for answering all my questions.\n\n\nWe could have also added any of the input modalities from Figure 4 to our demo but we will leave this to the reader as an exercise to build on top of the code shared in this blog post. We have kept the input modalities limited to two as part of this blog post:\n\nImage description (caption)\nMetadata (such as brightness, number of items per image)\n\nAs part of writing this blog post, we did experiment with other modalities such as:\n\nInput image (using an image to find similar images)\nColour palette (using color palette to find similar images matching the colour schema)\n\nPlease refer to Section 2.4 for our findings on our custom database. Using color palette was not giving satisying results. We tried both EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_XL and EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L models for the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about how to use color-palette and more metadata as inputs to the model\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Section 2.4 we will share with the reader how to extend the app to add color palette as an input the model on top of what has been shared in the demo.\nWe also showcase to the reader how to extend the app to use other metadata such as:\n\nCrowdedness score: number of humans\nSAM clutter score: number of SAM instances\nCOCO clutter score: number of COCO [55] instances\nCOCO instance diversity: number of unique COCO instance classes\nWalkability score: % of pixels belonging to walkable COCO semantic classes such as ‘road’\nSemantic diversity: number of unique COCO semantic classes\nCaption length: length of the caption in characters, words, and sentences\nGeometric complexity: angular variance of surface normals\nOcclusion score: % of occlusion edges over a fixed threshold\n\n\n\n\nHaving said that, let’s dig deep into the paper and understand how this model is able to distill information from multiple modalities.\nAs part of the training, each modality from Figure 2 was encoded using modality specific tokenizers. From the paper:\nWe employ suitable tokenization schemes for different modalities based on their format and performance. For image-like modalities and feature maps, we use spatial VQ-VAEs with optional diffusion decoders for detail rich modalities like RGB. For non-spatial modalities like global tokens or parameterized poses, we compress them to a fixed number of discrete tokens using Memcodes with MLP encoders and decoders. All sequence modalities are encoded as text using WordPiece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Tokenization overview\n\n\n\nWhat this means is that authors were able to represent information into a limited number of tokens for multiple modalities. By training modality specific tokenizers, the authors were able to transform different modalities into a common representation. After converting all modalities to a common representation, the authors were able to train a standard encoder-decoder transformer. During training, random subsets of these tokens are selected from all modalities as inputs and targets, and the objective is to predict one subset from the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Method overview\n\n\n\nThe complete method overview was shared by the authors in the 4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling Mizrahi et al. (2023) paper.\n\nMizrahi, David, Roman Bachmann, Oğuzhan Fatih Kar, Teresa Yeo, Mingfei Gao, Afshin Dehghan, and Amir Zamir. 2023. “4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06647.\nAs can be seen, here’s what’s exactly going on:\n\nFirst the different modalities are converted to a number of tokens using modality specific tokenizers\nA random subset of tokens are selected as input\nA random subset of tokens are selected as output\n\nBy doing so, the model learns to take in all or a subset of input modalities and predicts all or a subset of output modalities thus it is termed an “any-to-any vision model”.\nNow that we have a basic understanding of how the model works, let’ start building the retrieval app in Python."

    "text": "2.4 Appendix A\nWe used EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L for all our experiments and image retrieval due to memory constraints. We found EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_XL requires around 28GB of VRAM along with respective tokenizers, and runtimes were slow on a A100 40GB instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: rgb-to-any retrieval using EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Adding color palette as inputs\nFrom the paper:\nFor every RGB image, we extract between one and seven color palettes using PyPalette. During training, we randomly sample one of the color palettes to enable users to input palettes with different levels of granularity.\ncolor palette sequence is formed as color = c R = r G = g B = b R = r, … where c takes a value between 1 and 7 and specifies the number of colors in the palette and r, g, b takes values between 0-255.\nWe can write a small python function to convert any of seaborn color palettes to the required format. Also, as per the color palette transform, the tokenizer expexts “color” to be replaced by “v1” and r,g,b with “v0”.\nTherefore, a color palette represented by color=1 r=166 g=206 b=227 should be transformed to v1=1 v0=166 v0=206 v0=227.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\ndef generate_color_palette(num_colors=2, palette_name=\"Paired\"):\n    palette = sns.color_palette(palette_name, num_colors)\n    rgb_values = [(int(r*255), int(g*255), int(b*255)) for r, g, b in palette]\n    color_strings = [f\"v0={r} v0={g} v0={b}\" for r, g, b in rgb_values]\n    color_palette = f\"v1={num_colors} \" + \" \".join(color_strings)\n    return palette, color_palette\n\npalette, color_palette_string = generate_color_palette(num_colors=2)\npalette\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor_palette_string\n\n'v1=2 v0=166 v0=206 v0=227 v0=31 v0=120 v0=180'\n\n\nNow we can simply pass in the string above as input and use custom_text function on our batched_sample to prepare batch for input to the model. We also need to add color_palette to the conditional domain as input.\ncond_domains = [\"caption\", \"metadata\", \"color_palette\"]\nOnce that’s done, we can now take our color_palette_string as input and created the batched_sample as before in Section 2.3.2.\nbatched_sample = custom_text(\n    batched_sample,\n    input_text=caption,\n    eos_token=\"[EOS]\",\n    key=\"caption\",\n    device=DEVICE,\n    text_tokenizer=text_tokenizer,\n)\nAnd that’s it! Everything else remains the same!\n\n\n2.4.2 Adding more metadata as input\nIn the demo application, we only utilised brightness and number of items as metadata inputs. But as descriped in the paper, we could have used many more metadata as inputs.\nTo pass in any of the metadata available here, just pass in v1=[key] v0=[val] to the input string.\nFor example, to add in metadata: “brightness 50/255 contrast 50/127 walkability 25/50”, simply write it as:\nv1=10 v0=50 v1=11 v0=50 v1=14 v0=25\nWe simply replace the words by their corresponding metadata key and add the value with v0=[val].\nAnd that’s it! Now the reader can also add any of the 20 metadata filters that the authors have trained the 4M-21 model on."

    "text": "2.3 Python code for image retrieval\nWe will closely follow the demo notebook shared by the authors and build the retrieval sytem on top of it using a custom database (in this case a sample of 15 images).\nAs also mentioned in the paper,\nOur model can also perform multimodal retrievals by predicting global embeddings of DINOv2 and ImageBind from any (subset) of the input modalities. Once the global embeddings are obtained, the retrieval is done by finding the retrieval set samples with the smallest cosine distance to the query.\nWe can utilize either Imagebind or Dino-V2 to encode images as embeddings, as part of this demo we utilise DINOv2 global embeddings for retrieval.\nImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All Girdhar et al. (2023) and DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision Oquab et al. (2024) are both multi-modal vision models released previously by Meta. They are both capable of representing images to an embedding space. We donot dig deeper into these models as part of this blog post.\n\nGirdhar, Rohit, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Zhuang Liu, Mannat Singh, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Armand Joulin, and Ishan Misra. 2023. “ImageBind: One Embedding Space to Bind Them All.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05665.\n\nOquab, Maxime, Timothée Darcet, Théo Moutakanni, Huy Vo, Marc Szafraniec, Vasil Khalidov, Pierre Fernandez, et al. 2024. “DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features Without Supervision.” https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193.\n\n2.3.1 Building the database\nSince we wanted to showcase image description, brightness and number of items, our database consists of 15 images downloaded manually using google image search. The complete database can be found - here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about creating your own database\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating your own Huggingface dataset using an image folder is as simple as:\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"imagefolder\", data_dir=\"path/to/data\")\ndataset.push_to_hub()\nYou can read more about it here.\n\n\n\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"aroraaman/4m-21-demo\")\nlen(dataset['train'])\n\n15\n\n\nThe dataset consists of a mix of dark and bright images of dining room and swimming pool. Some images contain lot of items and are cluttered while others look more “empty”. Images are of type .png, .jpg, .webp we & .jpeg.\n\ndataset['train']['image']\n\n[&lt;PIL.WebPImagePlugin.WebPImageFile image mode=RGB size=852x1200&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=1280x853&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=P size=1500x1284&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=564x846&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=736x552&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=275x183&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=300x168&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=194x259&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=275x183&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=616x462&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=605x694&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=612x408&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=635x272&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.WebPImagePlugin.WebPImageFile image mode=RGB size=800x533&gt;,\n &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=2399x3229&gt;]\n\n\nNow that we have a list of images that we want to use as our database, let’s use DINOv2 to convert them to embeddings.\n\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport albumentations as A\nimport torch\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\nNow, let’s load the DINOv2 model as our feature extractor. Speicifically we will be using the ViT-B14 version as mentioned in the Bachmann et al. (2024) paper.\n\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nfeature_extractor = torch.hub.load('facebookresearch/dinov2', 'dinov2_vitb14')\nfeature_extractor = feature_extractor.to(device)\n\nUsing cache found in /home/ubuntu/.cache/torch/hub/facebookresearch_dinov2_main\nINFO:dinov2:using MLP layer as FFN\n\n\nWe transform every image by downsizing each image such that the shortest side is of size 224 pixels. We then center crop the image such that all images are of size 224x224. We use Albumentations library Buslaev et al. (2020) for the transforms.\n\nBuslaev, Alexander, Vladimir I. Iglovikov, Eugene Khvedchenya, Alex Parinov, Mikhail Druzhinin, and Alexandr A. Kalinin. 2020. “Albumentations: Fast and Flexible Image Augmentations.” Information 11 (2). https://doi.org/10.3390/info11020125.\n\nclass FeatureExtractionDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, feature_extractor: nn.Module, path: str, img_sz=224):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.feature_extractor=feature_extractor\n        self.path = Path(path)\n        self.files = list(self.path.rglob(\"*\"))\n        self.tfms = A.Compose([\n            A.SmallestMaxSize(img_sz),\n            A.CenterCrop(img_sz, img_sz)\n        ])\n        self.device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n        \n    def __len__(self): return len(self.files)\n    \n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        img = Image.open(self.files[idx]).convert(\"RGB\")\n        img = np.array(img)\n        img = self.tfms(image=img)['image']\n        img = torch.tensor(img, dtype=torch.float32)/255.\n        img = img.permute(2,0,1)\n        return img\n\nNext, we can simply build the dataset, dataloader and store the image embeddings as a PyTorch tensor.\n# Create the Dataset\ndataset = FeatureExtractionDataset(\n    feature_extractor=feature_extractor, \n    path=\"/path/to/data\"\n)\n# Create the DataLoader\ndataloader = DataLoader(\n    dataset,\n    batch_size=batch_size,  \n    shuffle=False,\n    num_workers=16,  \n    pin_memory=True\n)\nFinally we can extract the features from each image and store as a PyTorch Tensor.\nfeatures = []\nfor i,batch in tqdm(enumerate(dataloader), total=(len(dataset)//batch_size)+1):\n    batch = batch.to(device)\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        _f = feature_extractor(batch)\n    _f = _f.to(\"cpu\")\n    features.append(_f)\n    \nfeatures = torch.concat(features)\ntorch.save(features, \"./image_embeddings.pt\")\nAnd that’s it! We have successfully created our image database that we will retrieve similar images from based on a query.\n\n\n2.3.2 Inference with 4M-21model EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L to get most similar image\nSo now that we have the database, our next step is to actually be able to use inputs such as “caption”, “brightness” and “number of items” to get an embedding that will be used as our “query”.\nWe will closely follow the demo notebook shared by the authors.\n\nimport torch\nfrom fourm.models.fm import FM\nfrom fourm.vq.vqvae import VQVAE\nfrom tokenizers import Tokenizer\nfrom fourm.models.generate import (\n    GenerationSampler,\n    build_chained_generation_schedules,\n    init_empty_target_modality,\n    custom_text,\n)\nfrom fourm.data.modality_info import MODALITY_INFO\nfrom fourm.utils.plotting_utils import decode_dict\nfrom fourm.vq.vqvae import VQVAE\n\n\nDEVICE = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nIMG_SIZE = 224\nTOKENIZER_PATH = \"./fourm/utils/tokenizer/trained/text_tokenizer_4m_wordpiece_30k.json\"\nFM_MODEL_PATH = \"EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L\"\nIMAGE_DATASET_PATH = \"/home/ubuntu/GIT_REPOS/ml-4m/data/custom_data/\"\n\nAll tokenizers have been made available on the hub - EPFL VILAB. For our demo, we only need the text tokenizer, since we are using captions and metadata as inputs (both as text). We will also need to the fourm model to create the sampler that is able to create query embedding using input caption & metadata.\n\ntext_tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file(TOKENIZER_PATH)\nfm_model = FM.from_pretrained(FM_MODEL_PATH).eval().to(DEVICE)\nsampler = GenerationSampler(fm_model)\n\nBelow, our input conditional domains are caption & metadata. And our target domain is tok_dinov2_global. As discussed in the paper, we want to obtain the global embeddings of DINOv2 using input modalities for retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe authors shared how to do multimodal retrieval in code here.\n\n\n\n# Generation configurations\ncond_domains = [\"caption\", \"metadata\"]\ntarget_domains = [\"tok_dinov2_global\",]\ntokens_per_target = [16]\ngeneration_config = {\n    \"autoregression_schemes\": [\"roar\"],\n    \"decoding_steps\": [1],\n    \"token_decoding_schedules\": [\"linear\"],\n    \"temps\": [2.0],\n    \"temp_schedules\": [\"onex:0.5:0.5\"],\n    \"cfg_scales\": [1.0],\n    \"cfg_schedules\": [\"constant\"],\n    \"cfg_grow_conditioning\": True,\n}\ntop_p, top_k = 0.8, 0.0\n\nschedule = build_chained_generation_schedules(\n    cond_domains=cond_domains,\n    target_domains=target_domains,\n    tokens_per_target=tokens_per_target,\n    **generation_config\n)\n\nNow that we have a generation schedule to use caption and metadata as inputs to generate target tok_dinov2_global, we can create our dictionary of input and target modalities. let’s initialise the sample.\n\nbatched_sample = {}\nfor target_mod, ntoks in zip(target_domains, tokens_per_target):\n    batched_sample = init_empty_target_modality(\n        batched_sample, MODALITY_INFO, target_mod, 1, ntoks, DEVICE\n    )\n    \n\nLet’s say that we want to retrieve a dark image of a swimming pool. So our input caption would be ‘swimming pool’, and metadata is passed in combination of V1 and V0s.\nV1 represents which metadata to pass in, the encoding for each metadata type is here.\nBrightness is encoded with number 10, and takes in range of values from 0-255. 0 represents a dark image whereas 255 represents a bright image. So to represent a brightness of 50/255, we will write V1=10 V0=50.\n\ncaption = \"Swimming pool\"\nmetadata = \"v1=10 v0=68\" #brightness 68/255 as metadata\n\nLet’s create the required dictionaries by the model as input using custom_text method as in the demo notebook.\n\nbatched_sample = custom_text(\n    batched_sample,\n    input_text=caption,\n    eos_token=\"[EOS]\",\n    key=\"caption\",\n    device=DEVICE,\n    text_tokenizer=text_tokenizer,\n)\nbatched_sample = custom_text(\n    batched_sample,\n    input_text=metadata,\n    eos_token=\"[EOS]\",\n    key=\"metadata\",\n    device=DEVICE,\n    text_tokenizer=text_tokenizer,\n)\n\nNow, we can utilise the sampler that we created before to get the output from our model.\n\nout_dict = sampler.generate(\n    batched_sample,\n    schedule,\n    text_tokenizer=text_tokenizer,\n    verbose=True,\n    seed=0,\n    top_p=top_p,\n    top_k=top_k,\n)\n\n1it [00:00,  1.20it/s]\n\n\nThis output dictionary consists of tok_dinov2_global as key and the tensor represents the token IDs that make up the representation of the DINOv2 global embeddings.\n\nout_dict['tok_dinov2_global']['tensor']\n\ntensor([[5426, 6424, 5294, 5716,  189, 4065, 7631, 8145, 3108, 7638, 4331, 7005,\n         5675, 1472, 3069, 5687]], device='cuda:0')\n\n\nLet’s now use the decoder to get a 768 representation embedding for the image that becomes our “query” for retrieval purposes. To decode the tokens to the respective embedding, we will need to load the necessary VQ-VAE as well that was used during training.\n\nVQVAE_PATH = \"EPFL-VILAB/4M_tokenizers_DINOv2-B14-global_8k_16_224\"\nvqvae = VQVAE.from_pretrained(VQVAE_PATH)\n\nLet’s now get the image embeddings using decode_dict as in the demo notebook.\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    dec_dict = decode_dict(\n        out_dict, {\"tok_dinov2_global\": vqvae.to(DEVICE)}, text_tokenizer, \n        image_size=IMG_SIZE, patch_size=16, decoding_steps=1\n    )\n\n\ndec_dict[\"tok_dinov2_global\"].shape\n\ntorch.Size([768])\n\n\nAs can be seen we have an embedding of size 768 which is our query embedding. Using cosine similarity, we can retrieve the most similar embedding from our image database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Image retrieval using EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L for “swimming pool” and 68/255 brightness\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the model sucessfully returns the image of a swimming pool for low brightness. If we increased the brightness to 255/255 we get the following image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Image retrieval using EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L for “swimming pool” and 255/255 brightness\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Gradio app with required filters\nNow that we have all the underlying code, we can simply build a Gradio interface for the same! Why? This makes it very easy for all to use and play with the 4M-21 model. Feel free to create your own apps too. If you do, please don’t forget to let me know about it on my Twitter - https://x.com/amaarora.\nThe code for the gradio app is pretty simple, I actually used Claude 3.5 Sonnet to help me build the app.\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Image Retrieval using 4M-21: An Any-to-Any Vision Model\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column(scale=1):\n            caption = gr.Textbox(\n                label=\"Caption Description\", placeholder=\"Enter image description...\"\n            )\n            brightness = gr.Slider(\n                minimum=0, maximum=255, value=5, step=1, \n                label=\"Brightness\", info=\"Adjust image brightness (0-255)\"\n            )\n            num_items = gr.Slider(\n                minimum=0, maximum=50, value=5, step=1, \n                label=\"Number of Items\", info=\"Number of COCO instances in image (0-50)\"\n            )\n        with gr.Column(scale=1):\n            output_images = gr.Gallery(\n                label=\"Retrieved Images\",\n                show_label=True,\n                elem_id=\"gallery\",\n                columns=2,\n                rows=2,\n                height=512,\n            )\n    submit_btn = gr.Button(\"Retrieve Most Similar Image\")\n    submit_btn.click(\n        fn=get_similar_images,\n        inputs=[caption, brightness, num_items],\n        outputs=output_images,\n    )\nUsing above code, allows us to create the Gradio app that was shared in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: caption & metadata retrieval using EPFL-VILAB/4M-21_L\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Deploy app to HuggingFace hub\nWe have deployed the app sucessfully to huggingface Spaces. We followed the documentation here.\nYou can find the huggingface space here.\nSomem minor changes that we had to do between local and for the app to deployed on huggingface spaces:\n\nAll binary files had to be tracked by git-lfs. Read more about it here\nConvert dataset to a huggingface dataset, as we were not able to upload .jpg, .png or other files\nThe complete source code for the gradio app that works on HF spaces can be found here.\n\nOverall it was pretty straightforward and easy to deploy!"

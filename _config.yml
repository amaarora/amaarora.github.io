title: Making commits each day, towards a better future 
description: Hi everyone and welcome to my blog. This is a place where I write freely and try to uncomplicate the complicated through Python code. My journey in Machine Learning started not so long ago, so you and I are both in agreement, that I have plenty to learn. In this blog, I try to explain what I know in a concise language so that someone after me doesn't have to go through the same pain that I went through the first time. If you feel that some ideas can be expressed more clearly, I am very happy to recieve constructive feedback. Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or my email.

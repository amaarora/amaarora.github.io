## Introduction
Welcome to "**The Annotated GPT-2**". 

One of the most brilliant and well-explained articles I have ever read is [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html). It introduced *attention* like no other post ever written. The simple idea was to present an "annotated" version of the paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) along with code.

Something I have come to realize with my little experience in Machine Learning, when you write things in code, the implementation and the secrets become clearer. It is not magic anymore. 

Jeffrey Friedl in the book [Mastering Regular Expressions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-regular-expressions/0596528124/ch01.html) said:
>  There is nothing magic about magic. The magician merely understands something simple which doesn’t appear to be simple or natural to the untrained audience. Once you learn how to hold a card while making your hand look empty, you only need practice before you, too, can “do magic.”

The **[GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)** might seem like magic at first with all it's glitter and beauty too, but hopefully I would have uncovered that magic for you and revealed all the tricks by the time you finish reading this post. That is my goal. To make it as simple as possible for the keen to understand how the **GPT-2** model works underneath. 

**Note:** Pretty much the entirety of the code has been copied, inspired and referenced from [Hugging Face's implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/modeling_gpt2.py) of the GPT-2. You can get to know more about Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/). I am not trying to reinvent the wheel, but merely bringing together a list of prexisting excellent resources to make it easier for the reader to grasp GPT-2. 

## Prerequisites
To understand the GPT-2 model completely, we will first need to take a deep dive inside Transformers. The GPT-2 is a Transformer based architecture utilizing the Decoder only part. Here is an excellent list of resources to aid your understanding regarding Transformers:

## Abstract
Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.

## Model
We use a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al., 2017) based architecture for our LMs. The model largely follows the details of the [OpenAI GPT model](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) (Radford et al., 2018) with a few modifications. [Layer normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) (Ba et al., 2016) was moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a pre-activation residual network (He et al., 2016) and an additional layer normalization was added after the final self-attention block. A modified initialization which accounts for the accumulation on the residual path with model depth is used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initialization by a factor of 1/√N where N is the number of residual layers. The vocabulary is expanded to 50,257. We also **increase the context size from 512 to 1024** tokens and a larger batchsize of 512 is used.

> This is the entirety of model explanation inside the `GPT-2` research paper. This warrants a need for us to look at the architecture inside the `GPT` model.

## Model Specifications (GPT)
Our model largely follows the original transformer work. We trained a **12-layer decoder-only transformer** with **masked self-attention heads** (768 dimensional states and 12 attention heads). For the position-wise feed-forward networks, we used 3072 dimensional inner states. We used the Adam optimization scheme with a max learning rate of 2.5e-4. The learning rate was increased linearly from zero over the first 2000 updates and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule. We train for 100 epochs on minibatches of 64 randomly sampled, contiguous sequences of 512 tokens. Since [layernorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) is used extensively throughout the model, a simple weight initialization of **N(0, 0.02)** was sufficient. We used a **bytepair encoding (BPE)** vocabulary with 40,000 merges and residual, embedding, and attention dropouts with a rate of 0.1 for regularization. We also employed a modified version of L2 regularization proposed in, with w = 0.01 on all non bias or gain weights. For the activation function, we used the [Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415).

> "One thing that surprises and amazes me about [Jeremy Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_(entrepreneur)) is his ability to distill talks in such a very simple manner that as someone in the audience, you're able to comprehend and relate to! He makes complex ideas look easy and seems to have a much deeper understanding of things. He's bold and yet very humble."
 
This is what I told my partner after I recently attended Jeremy's talk live in Brisbane. I am based in Sydney but flew to Brisbane to be a part of [this meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Queensland_AI/events/276959669/) which was meant to be a live Q&A session with Jeremy. But, to my surprise, it rather turned out to be a talk by Jeremy where he shared his experience of founding multiple startups and compared Australia's startup culture to that in the US. 
 
As part of this blog, I'd to share what I learned and also try to summarise the talk from the lens of someone who's not a Ph.D. and is self-taught in AI - thanks to the wonderful [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course. 

> **NOTE:** The talk is also available on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uygOz2fORo).

## Australia invested a meagre 0.29% of global investment in AI in 2020
The talk began by stating a very simple statistic from Stanford's [Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021](https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-2021) - "Australia invested around 0.29% of total global AI investment in 2020".

But, even after this, Jeremy starts by making an argument that "Australia is a great place to start a tech startup or do AI research despite the obvious issues". 

Interesting, right? And he defends this argument by sharing his journey and his experience of founding 4 tech startups - [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), Optimal Decisions Group, [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com/) & [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) - and that of having lived in the SF bay area for around 10 years. He was also the president & chief scientist of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Don't listen to old people
Jeremy started his journey in consulting at [Mckinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) to learn about business and he also worked at other consulting companies along the way. This helped him learn some valuable skills around - *"how to influence people" & "how to influence organizations"* but the actual feedbacks on his initial ideas weren't very positive. 

When he first presented an idea about building dynamic websites using [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering#:~:text=In%20the%20newer%2C%20narrower%20sense,from%20many%20users%20(collaborating).) to one of the directors at a consulting firm, the feedback he received was this, quote - 
> "You have no idea how companies work. This isn't a company. Companies are about competition, about market forces. This is nerdy technology." 

He had similar feedback the second time around too for a different idea on using algorithms to find interesting websites based on user's history. 

So, based on his overall experience of learning business, he had his first piece of advice for potential people planning on doing tech startups - 

> "Don't listen to old people. Unless, it's explicitly about the thing that "you" want to do and they have years of experience doing that thing in the way "you" want to do it. Otherwise, "you" get these biases about business as usual without the status quo."

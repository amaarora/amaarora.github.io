> "One thing that surprises and amazes me about [Jeremy Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_(entrepreneur)) is his ability to distill talks in such a very simple manner that as someone in the audience, you're able to comprehend and relate to! He makes complex ideas look easy and seems to have a much deeper understanding of things. He's bold and yet very humble."
 
This is what I told my partner after I recently attended Jeremy's talk live in Brisbane. I am based in Sydney but flew to Brisbane to be a part of - [Open Q&A with Jeremy Howard (of Fast.ai, Masks4All, Enlitic, Kaggle, FastMail)](https://www.meetup.com/Queensland_AI/events/276959669/), which was meant to be a live Q&A session with Jeremy. But, to my surprise, it rather turned out to be a talk by Jeremy where he shared his experience of founding multiple startups and compared Australia's startup culture to that of the US. 
 
As part of this blog, I'd to share what I learned and also try to summarise the talk from the lens of someone who's not a Ph.D. and is self-taught in AI - thanks to the [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course. 

> **NOTE:** The talk is also available on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uygOz2fORo).

## Australia invested a meager 0.29% of global investment in AI in 2020
The talk began by stating a very simple statistic from Stanford's [Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021](https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-2021) - "Australia invested around 0.29% of the total global AI investment in 2020".

![](/images/AI_investment_in_AUS.png "figure-1 Private investment in AI by Country, 2020")

But, even after this, Jeremy starts by making an argument - **"Australia is a great place to start a tech startup or do AI research despite the obvious issues"**. 

Interesting, right? And he defends this argument by sharing his journey and his experience of founding/co-founding 5 tech startups - [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), Optimal Decisions Group, [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) & [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) - and that of having lived in the SF bay area for around 10 years. 

## Don't listen to old people
Jeremy started his journey in consulting at [Mckinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) to learn about business and he also worked at other consulting companies along the way. This helped him learn some valuable skills around - *"how to influence people" & "how to influence organizations"* but the actual feedbacks on his initial ideas weren't very positive. 

When he first presented an idea about building dynamic websites using [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering#:~:text=In%20the%20newer%2C%20narrower%20sense,from%20many%20users%20(collaborating).) to one of the directors at a consulting firm, the feedback he received was this, quote - 
> "You have no idea how companies work. This isn't a company. Companies are about competition, about market forces. This is nerdy technology." 

He had similar feedback the second time around too for a different idea on using algorithms to find interesting websites based on user's history. 

So, based on his overall experience of learning business, he had his first piece of advice for potential people planning on doing tech startups - 

> "Don't listen to old people. Unless, it's explicitly about the thing that "you" want to do and they have years of experience doing that thing in the way "you" want to do it. Otherwise, "you" get these biases about business as usual without the status quo."

## In Australia, don't try to be an Australian company
After his initial gig at consulting which lasted around 10 years, Jeremy founded not one but two startups within 1 month of each other: 
1. [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) 
2. Optimal Decisions Group

As someone with a background in consulting, he didn't know much about the Australian startup scene - and thus, didn't have any government funding or grants. These were companies that weren't Australian startups but rather startups, that happened to be in Australia! 

He mentioned that since he had more access to global customers, it never occurred to him that these companies were bounded by geographical boundaries. In fact, these were two companies that were competing on a global stage!

:thought_balloon:: I found this bit to be really interesting, as I also work for similar company that I believe is also competing on a global stage - [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). Even though the company was founded in San Francisco, it has clients worldwide. It's solving problems that benefit the world and not just the US in general. 

## To be a tech founder requires this weird combination of great humility and arrogance
For the next startup that Jeremy co-founded alongside Anthony Goldbloom - [Kaggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle), they went to San Francisco to try and get funding. 

Jeremy stated and I quote:
> "With Kaggle we decided to try a different approach which was to get VC funding. I said to Anthony who we're doing this with, let's not even try to get funding in Australia because Australia doesn't fund tech startups. In fact, The amount of funding of startups in Australia in a year is less than the amount of funding of startups in the US in a day. So we went to San Francisco to try and get funding."

In San Francisco, Jeremy had a very different experience than that in Australia. He shared examples of how Mark Andreson and Vinod Khosla were ready to invest $5M when in fact, he had initially thought to seek $500K of funding. He observed a very different theme in the bay area, which was, quote:

> Everytime we'd say we want to do `X`, people would say 'Woah, okay, that's great. **What if you could make an even bigger `X`**?

This was a very different experience from what Jeremy had found doing his startups in Australia, quote: 
> Oh, I am trying to create an email company that does like synchronized email and I am trying to sell it on the internet and almost everybody would say like "Why"? Microsoft & Yahoo already have an email service. Obviously there is no chance you can beat them, so why're you doing this? **Is there something smaller you could do?**

Jeremy said, quote: 
> "To be a tech founder requires a whole lot of arrogance. You need the arrogance to believe that you can actually build something that other people are going to want to buy and the other people that will come along and compete with you won't do as good as you, and you can win! But you also need the humility to recognize that other people along and they actually have some better ideas than you so sometimes you should borrow those ideas, or sometimes you should try and find ways to do it better. So **it requires this weird combination of great humility and arrogance**." 

:thought_balloon:: As someone who has never been a tech founder, I couldn't relate to this, but, it was very satisfying to hear as I do believe my personality to have this weird mix. I was more able to think of this in terms of having the tenacity to not give up when working on difficult projects, and the humility to learn from others who know more than you. IMHO, [this PR](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/pull/554) is one such example that requires this weird mix.

Jeremy also compared Australia to the bay area, below, I summarize:
|       | US      | Australia |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Theme | What if you could do an even bigger or better "X"?      | Is there something smaller that you could do?       |
| Cultural difference | Oh, it's really cool that you're to do something better!      | Why aren't you OK with what's already there? Why build something new?       |
| VCs - Academics | VCs would call academics and ask for their opinion on new ideas.       | You don't see this strong connection between investors and academics.       |

## Moving to San Francisco was interesting
After raising money for Kaggle, Jeremy moved to San Francisco. 

In the US, Jeremy was really starstruck - he would notice that meetups are hosted at Google or Facebook. He would be one day talking to a Google product manager and would definitely feel very starstruck. But the other thing he really noticed was, that while he was talking to these legends, they're actually "pretty normal"! Jeremy said and I quote: 

> I kind of expected them to be at another level. I felt that as a little Australian nobody, I would just be dominated by these people. But, no! When I compared them to my mates back in Australia, I kind of realized that the Australian talent pool is just fantastic. But, there's this huge difference in opportunity and belief. 

:thought_balloon:: At this point, I have to say that after hearing this, I got very excited! It's because I remember saying the same thing a few months ago when I was looking for a job in deep learning in Australia! In fact, I would compare myself to my friends from university who moved to the US and are now working at giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and because I knew them, I was like they're no different than me! Then, why in Australia do I "need to have a Ph.D." to work at these companies? Why can't I at least be given a chance to interview like my peers in the US? Anyway, long story short, I ended up working for a US-based company from Australia.

This experience gave Jeremy more self-confidence as an Australian as he realized that "Australians are actually not way behind". Jeremy also found that folks in the U.S were on the whole more bold and even though they were in the centre of the world's biggest marketplace, they were still actually more global! He stressed that "We really that attitude in Australia".

## Around 2012, I started noticing deep learning starting to win things
In this part of the talk, Jeremy shared about the way he felt and still feels about deep learning. 

Since Jeremy was cheif scientist and president at Kaggle, he actually got to validate the winning solutions. So, he was always really seeing what are the actual best ways to do things. 

And around 2012, Jeremy started noticing deep learning to win things or at least do pretty well! But, one of Jeremy's real concerns was, quote: 
> People using these neural nets were all the same person. They were from 1 of 5 universities that were all very exclusive. They were all white, they were all male and they were all solving like stupid problems like trying to find their cats in their photos. I mean look okay it's nice to find cats in your photos, people make a lot of money from that. But, where were the people trying to deal with global water shortages or access to education or dealing with huge economic inequity - it wasn't on the radar.

Jeremy said that he knew that this was because it wasn't a diverse set of people solving the problems. He felt that perhaps there is something he could do about this. 

He shared that he feels about deep learning to be a fundamental technology like "electricity" and also shared examples to showcase the power of what deep learning can do today by showing [DALL-E from OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [AlphaFold from Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery).

Below, I also share [DALL-E from OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) which is a deep learning model, that can generate images given some text input: 

![](/images/dall-e.png "figure-2 DALL-E Creating Images from Text")

To someone who doesn't know what's going on, this feels like "magic". Jeremy said that there are people who feel like deep learning is some technology on another level that only a select people can do. And Jeremy completely disagrees with this.

Jeremy also mentioned that deep learning really is just kind of one algorithm with little changes that go between one model and another. When Jeremy looked at the source code for the AlphaGo model, he found that the model was almost identical to the computer vision object recognition models that Jeremy had used.

## Noone was doing deep learning in medicine
Jeremy realized that there actually was some low hanging fruit at that time with deep learning and it was actually "medicine". He said and I quote: 
> Noone was literally was doing deep learning in medicine. 

He found that there is a such a shortage gobally of medical specialists and of doctors, that, according to the [world economic forum](https://www.weforum.org/), it's going to take 300 years to fill in the gap to allow the developing world to have access to the same ,medical expertise as a developed world. 

Stunned by this statistic, Jeremy thought maybe there is something he could do to help the doctors be more productive by adding deep learning to their workflow. He, alogn with three others, spent 4 weeks training a deep learning model on lung CT-scans which, to their surprise, turned out to have much lower false-posiives and false-negatives when compared to a panel of 4 radiologists. 

This turned out to be his next startup called [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com/). Jeremy mentioned that this turned out to be both great and dissapointing. It turned out great because as he had envisioned, it helped put deep learning on the map for medicine and it is now everywhere in radiology. But, **he still felt he was doing so little when there were so many other problems to be solved**. 

## To do deep learning, you "don't" need a P.h.D
Jeremy felt that there are all these wonderful people in the world solving important problems like disaster resilience, or access to food and they don't have a way to tap in to this extremely powerful tool - "deep learning".

Jeremy said and I quote: 
> So between this and this kind concern about inequality, and the kind of exclusivity and the kind of homogenous group of people working on deep learning, Rachel and I decided to start something new - **[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)**. 

Jeremy also said and I quote:
> [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) is all about helping everybody do what Enlitic is doing but not having a bunch of deep learning people do it, but to have disaster resilience built by disaster resilience people and have oncology stuff built by oncology people.

:thought_balloon:: And I am so glad for the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course! Had it not been for [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), I believe I would have paid a fortune to learn deep learning and it would possibly have taken me a lot longer to understand the technology. I recently also wrote a tweet about "[Why I blog](https://twitter.com/amaarora/status/1381013764518993920)" which included how fast.ai was at the centre of all my learnings. So, thanks Jeremy and Rachel for doing this! For those of you that don't know about, [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), it's most notably known for the [fastai library](https://docs.fast.ai/) and the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/), which is based on a top-down approach where you build image classification models first without actually understanding how they work. Then, you slowly go into the details until you know everything that there is to know. This approach just works!

In fact, Jeremy also mentioned that through fast.ai, they've till date trained hundreds of thousands of people and every few days people share how fast.ai has helped them publish new papers in a top journal, get a job or bring deep learning to their respective startups. This is wonderful to hear as I am also definitely one of those people who have benefited greatly from fast.ai.

## Coming back to Australia was like this huge breath of fresh-air
Few months ago, Jeremy came back to Australia and mentioned that coming back to Australia has been "amazing"! 

For those of you that don't know, Jeremy actually grew up in Australia. And he mentioned that having lived in Australia his whole life, he kind of always had this vague sense that Australia had a great working culture, and after spending 10 years in America, **"coming back to Australia was like this huge breath of fresh air"**.

But, Jeremy was also surprised at how little had changed since he had left. He was trying to find people doing really world-class deep learning research or building startups having huge global impact and he wasn't really able to find it. He also presented some charts related to this:


![](/images/investment.png "figure-3 High performing countries hvae a strong seed and angel investment sector")

As can be seen from figure-3 above, from an investing point of view, seed of angel investment in Australia per capita is an order of magnitude behind the US. 

Similarly he also shared some more data on investment activity and lack of investment in research. 

![](/images/gds.png "figure-4 Lack of investment in research")

In general, Jeremy also shared that Australia's ICT share of global value added to the economy has fallen over the last 25 years as in figure-5 below. 

![](/images/gva.png "figure-5 Australian tech share of GVA to the economy")

Jeremy mentioned that these were data points that reflect what he was seeing - and I have to agree - being in Australia, you do feel that there is this very limited number of people and organizations actually investing in technology. 

Finally, he also presented a deloitte study as in figure-6 below:

![](/images/conservative.png "figure-6 Australian customers are very conservative")

As per this study, 50% of the enterprises said that we want to catch up and keep up for their main reason of being interested in AI!
